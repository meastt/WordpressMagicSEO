# Article Generation QA System - Comprehensive Fixes

## Overview
This document details the comprehensive QA system implemented to fix three critical issues found in article generation:

1. **Image Generation Failures** - Images not being inserted into articles
2. **Incomplete Content** - Only 3-4 of 15 recipes were complete
3. **Temporal Context Issues** - Content written as if it's early 2025 when created in late October

---

## Issues Identified

### Issue #1: Image Generation Bug
**Problem:** Images were being generated by Gemini API successfully but failing to process and insert into articles.

**Root Cause:** The Gemini SDK returns a `google.genai.types.GeneratedImage` object with an `.image` attribute, but this is a Pydantic wrapper, not a PIL Image object. The code was trying to access `.mode` and `.size` attributes directly, causing an AttributeError.

**Error Log:**
```
AttributeError: 'Image' object has no attribute 'mode'
File "/var/task/gemini_image_generator.py", line 139, in generate_image
    print(f"  üñºÔ∏è  PIL Image mode: {pil_image.mode}, size: {pil_image.size}")
```

### Issue #2: Incomplete Recipe Content
**Problem:** Article titled "15 griddle breakfast recipes ideas for 2025" only delivered 3-4 complete recipes. The remaining 11-12 recipes were just intro lines with no actual recipe content.

**Root Causes:**
- `max_tokens` set to 8000 was insufficient for 15 detailed recipes
- No validation to ensure all promised content was delivered
- No explicit prompt instructions about delivering complete recipes

### Issue #3: Temporal Context Issues
**Problem:** Content created on October 31, 2025 used phrases like "kick the year off right" which are only appropriate for early January.

**Root Cause:** The content generator had basic date context but lacked seasonal awareness and time-of-year appropriate language guidance.

## Solutions Implemented

### Fix #1: Enhanced Image Extraction Logic
**File:** `gemini_image_generator.py` (lines 103-193)

**Changes:**
- Added comprehensive Pydantic model handling
- Implemented multiple fallback methods to extract PIL Image:
  1. Check for `_pil_image` attribute
  2. Try `to_pil()` method
  3. Verify with `mode` and `size` attribute checks
  4. Use `model_dump()` for Pydantic models
  5. Check for bytes data in dumped model
  6. Fallback to `__bytes__()` method
- Added extensive logging to debug image object types
- Better error handling with try-except blocks

**Impact:** Images will now be successfully extracted and inserted into articles.

### Fix #2A: Increased Token Limit
**File:** `claude_content_generator.py` (line 272)

**Change:**
```python
# Before
max_tokens=8000

# After
max_tokens=16000  # Increased from 8000 to support complex content
```

**Impact:** AI has 2x more tokens to generate complete content for complex articles.

### Fix #2B: Recipe Completeness Prompt Enhancement
**File:** `claude_content_generator.py` (lines 185-211)

**Changes:**
- Auto-detects list/recipe articles from title (e.g., "15 recipes", "10 tips")
- Adds critical completeness requirements to prompt:
  - Explicit count requirement (e.g., "You MUST deliver ALL 15 COMPLETE recipes")
  - Minimum length per item (150-200 words)
  - Requirements for each recipe (ingredients + preparation steps)
  - Warning against incomplete items

**Impact:** AI receives clear, explicit instructions to deliver all promised content.

### Fix #2C: Comprehensive QA Validation Module
**File:** `content_qa_validator.py` (NEW - 411 lines)

**Features:**
- **Word Count Validation:** Ensures minimum word count is met
- **Recipe/List Completeness:**
  - Auto-detects expected count from title
  - Validates each recipe has substantial content (>100 chars)
  - Reports incomplete recipes by number
- **Image Validation:**
  - Counts both `<img>` tags and `[Image:]` placeholders
  - Warns about unprocessed placeholders
- **Table Validation:** Checks for expected tables
- **Temporal Context Validation:**
  - Detects inappropriate seasonal language
  - Warns about "kick off the year" in non-January months
  - Checks for summer/winter language mismatches
- **Structure Validation:** H2/H3 counts, lists, proper HTML
- **SEO Metadata Validation:** Meta title/description length, categories, tags

**Validation Report Format:**
```
================================================================================
üìã CONTENT QA VALIDATION REPORT
================================================================================

‚úÖ All validation checks passed | ‚ö†Ô∏è  3 warnings

‚ùå ERRORS (MUST FIX):
   - Recipe count mismatch: Found 4 recipe headers, expected 15
   - Word count too low: 1200 words (minimum: 2000)

‚ö†Ô∏è  WARNINGS (SHOULD FIX):
   - Temporal context issues: Inappropriate phrase for October 31: 'kick off the year'
   - Found 5 unprocessed image placeholders

‚úÖ PASSED CHECKS:
   ‚úÖ Content is not empty
   ‚úÖ Meta title good: 58 chars
   ‚úÖ Categories: 4
================================================================================
```

### Fix #2D: QA Integration into Workflow
**File:** `api/generate.py` (lines 962-1011)

**Changes:**
- Added QA validation after content generation and image processing
- Auto-detects expected elements from title
- Runs comprehensive validation
- Prints detailed QA report to logs
- Adds `qa_validation` to API response for frontend visibility
- Continues with publishing even if QA fails (warns user)

**Impact:** Every article is automatically validated before publishing with detailed reports.

### Fix #3: Enhanced Temporal Context
**File:** `claude_content_generator.py` (lines 98-155)

**Changes:**
- **Season Detection:**
  - Winter (Dec, Jan, Feb)
  - Spring (Mar, Apr, May)
  - Summer (Jun, Jul, Aug)
  - Fall (Sep, Oct, Nov)

- **Time-of-Year Context:**
  - Early January: "kick off the year" appropriate
  - Late January: new year references OK, avoid "kicking off"
  - February: focus on current season, not new year
  - March-April: renewal, fresh starts, spring cleaning
  - May-June: outdoor activities, warm weather
  - July-August: vacation, outdoor cooking
  - September: back to school, routine
  - October: Halloween, autumn harvest, cozy themes
  - November: Thanksgiving, holiday prep
  - December: holiday season

- **Explicit Language Requirements:**
  ```
  ‚ö†Ô∏è  CONTEXTUAL LANGUAGE REQUIREMENTS:
  - Use language appropriate for the CURRENT time of year
  - Do NOT use 'kick off the year' unless it's early January
  - Reference the current season naturally
  - Match the mood and themes for this time of year
  ```

**Impact:** Content will use contextually appropriate language for the current season and time of year.

### Fix #4: Dependencies
**File:** `requirements.txt` (line 10)

**Addition:**
```
beautifulsoup4>=4.12.0
```

**Reason:** Required by `ContentQAValidator` for HTML parsing.
