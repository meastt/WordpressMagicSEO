<h2>What To Look For When Buying A Budget Smoker </h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">The word budget implies something cheap and nasty afoot when this is not the case. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">However, you need to be careful as some smoking traps await the reckless buyer. Let's look at the various factors to consider when buying a budget smoker.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Best Budget Smokers- Stick To Your Budget </h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">The smokers we are looking at here are all available for under $450 from Amazon unless otherwise stated. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">This is a good budget range for a smoker, especially a beginner. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">While many smokers cost more than $450 and can run into the thousands, you don't need to spend that to get a quality smoker and enjoy the treats of smoked meats and foods with your friends and family.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Stick to your predetermined budget. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Don't be tempted to spend more than you want to, as there are more than enough good quality smokers out there that will fit into your budget and below it.</p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Best Budget Smokers - Look For Build And Material Quality </h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">As a concession, you will know that budget smokers will generally be made from lighter steel and won't have any fancy electronics or top-level insulation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">But that doesn't mean you can grab a bargain.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Check for online reviews and customer feedback which is easier to do these days than ever before, and use quality websites and social media. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Those reviews alone will give you a good idea of whether the product you are considering is worth the money.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">The good news is that while the budget smokers may not last a lifetime, they sure will get the job done. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">With some care and maintenance, they can over-deliver on their investment.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Check the materials used in construction. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Most <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Country-Smokers-CSGDL0590-Highland-4-Burner/dp/B088RK43CP?tag=griddleking01-20&ref_=as_li_ss_tl&linkCode=sl1&linkId=2b41f5f337617dabe31f2ac8255cf4b8" target="_blank" rel="nofollow sponsored noopener" data-lasso-id="6133" data-lasso-name="Country Smokers CSGDL0590 The Highland 4-Burner Portable Griddle, Large, Black" data-lasso-lid="7725">smokers</a> should use stainless steel for the body and grill grates and see whether you have insulation, especially when looking at vertical bullet-type smokers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Remember that good insulation will mean less fuel and shorter cooking times. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">When looking at electric smokers, check the power rating as well. You don't want to buy something that will cost you a mint to cook with either.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Consider The Fuel Source On A Budget Smoker </h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">When buying a <a href="https://griddleking.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Griddle-King-3-1.png" data-lasso-id="6134">budget smoker</a>, you need to determine what fuel source you would prefer, and this will depend on a few factors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">It will affect your choice of smoker when deciding where you will be cooking, whether you need to consider neighbors, and how many people you'll be cooking for. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Fuel availability when at outdoor campsites and how much effort you want to expend when cooking and as well as cleaning will all affect your choice of smoker.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">If you will be smoking outside without worrying about the volume of smoke and whether your neighbors are likely to complain, coal and wood would be ideal. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Bear in mind that most offset smokers will use coal and wood, and some will use gas, while vertical smokers will use mostly coal or electricity.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>The Creosote Factor </h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">If you are going to be using wood, you need to be aware of the creosote factor. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">This is a by-product of wood combustion, and it lays a bitter layer of thick oily grime on the meat and the smoker.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Creosote is caused when the combustion conditions of wood are less than ideal.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">It comes from the thick white <a href="https://griddleking.com/can-you-use-fig-wood-bbq-smoke/" data-lasso-id="9640">smoke seen when the wood</a> is wet, there is too much fuel, the oxygen mix inside the cooker is too low, or the wood is wet.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Bear this in mind when considering your fuel source. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Creosote can be avoided when the combustion conditions are favorable.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">But this may take some time to perfect and meat contaminated with creosote is not fit for consumption.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Consider The Cooking Area Of Your Budget Smoker </h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">If you're going to be cooking for big family gatherings and will have a lot of food on the go, then coal or wood-based fuel source would be better as it is cheap and plentiful.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Often, the offset smokers that use this will have large cooking areas.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Offset smokers generally have larger cooking areas than vertical smokers. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Still, many vertical smokers like the Weber Smokey Mountain have dual cooking <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Traeger-Pellet-Grills-TFB30KLF-Tailgater/dp/B082N6BV3X?tag=griddleking01-20&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="nofollow sponsored noopener" data-lasso-id="6135" data-lasso-name="Traeger Grills Tailgater 20 Portable Wood Pellet Grill and Smoker, Black" data-lasso-lid="8727">grills</a> to have a fair volume of food on the go at one time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Indoor Vs. Outdoor Budget Smokers </h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Suppose you will be mainly doing your cooking when outdoors or at camping sites. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Coal or wood is a better option as you can find this pretty much anywhere, while gas supply or an electrical outlet may not be as freely available.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">If you live in an apartment block or proximity to people in a residential estate or compact living, then an electric or gas option may be better as they don't emit as much smoke.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Budget Smokers –Cooking Effort, Cleaning &amp; Maintenance </h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Lastly, you need to consider that coal and wood smokers require more attention during cooking to maintain smoke density and temperature. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">At the same time, electric and gas cookers don't need much attention.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">If you are content to simply 'set-and-forget,' spend time socializing and occasionally check your meat, then an electric smoker would suit you better. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">If you want to get into the real nuts and bolts of smoking, managing smoke and temperature using the vents, then an offset wood or coal smoker would be your first choice.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Offset Smokers Require More Cleaning And Maintenance </h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">When you compare the effort needed to clean and maintain the condition of a smoker after cooking, vertical electric smokers require the least amount of cleaning and maintenance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">They are often made of particular materials that don't facilitate the accumulation of grime, grease, and creosote, so cleaning them is less frequent and not as vigorous. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00365FI9E?tag=griddleking01-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow sponsored noopener" data-lasso-id="6136" data-lasso-name="Char-Broil 12201570-A1 American Gourmet Offset Smoker, Black,Standard" data-lasso-lid="15470">Offset smokers</a> will need to be cleaned after every smoke or every second one and deep cleaned once or twice a year and seasoned. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">In contrast, vertical smokers, especially electric ones, are easier to maintain and clean and often don't require seasoning.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Budget Smokers – Features And Warranties </h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">While these are budget smokers, there are some essential features that you should look to have on yours, and one of those is the lid thermometer. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Knowing your ideal cooking temperature and maintaining it is critical to producing good quality flavor and adequately cooked meats.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Most good manufacturers will offer a warranty even on their budget products, which is a non-negotiable when buying a budget smoker. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">If you see an outstanding deal but poor or no warranty, that is best left alone.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Now you know what elements to look for in a budget smoker, let's get into the best budget smokers available.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Another consideration is the length of the gas cylinder hose. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">At 40 inches, it gives you enough space to store the cylinder well away from the unit, as most people don't enjoy walking around the cylinder to avoid impact with your shins and feet while cooking.</p>

<h2>Best Budget Electric Smoker -Char-Broil Deluxe Digital Electric Smoker -$215</h2>

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">At first glance, this smoker looks like a refrigerator.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h2>Best Versatile Budget Smoker - Camp Chef 24" Smoke Vault -$400 (Walmart)</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">As a gas smoker, one of the most significant issues is the lack of versatility regarding temperature controls. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">This can limit the capability of the smoker should the cook require higher flash temperatures or opt for lower, slower cooking options.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">This compact unit operates between 160F and 400F, so it has an excellent range for various foods. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">While some criticisms have been leveled about the door seal and reliability on the temperature dial, overall reviews show a cooker that heats up fast and produces excellent flavor and consistency.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Unlike the insulated Weber, and as is the case with most box-type smokers, there is no insulation. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">You will get some smoke leaking out and temperature, but gas is more easily controlled than coal and wood, so a bit of practice will have this aspect covered.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">At 75lbs and delivering some 18000 BTU in heat, the Camp Chef is the best option if you need to cook and smoke a range of foods, whether on your patio, balcony, or campsite.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">As one of the heavier units on offer at 146lbs, it won't be the easiest to move and will take up some space.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">So, this would not be an option if you are limited in your cooking area. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">The cooking area is a good size at 830 sq inches. </p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p style="font-size:21px">It can double up as a charcoal griller by making a pit of coals and then using the cast iron grates as the grill surface.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">As offset smokers go, this is one of the cheapest available, and with care and regular maintenance, this smoker should last you a good few years. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">The heat and smoke distribution are good from the offset firebox, and you will get the temperature and smoke volume right with a bit of practice.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
