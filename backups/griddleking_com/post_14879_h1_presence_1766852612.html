The first step to getting started with your flat top grill is to make sure that it’s properly connected to a gas source or electrical outlet. If you’re using a gas grill, make sure your propane tank is full and that all of the valve connections are tight before turning it on. Once the grill is securely connected, turn it on and allow the flat top surface to heat up and become hot.

Once the grill is hot, it’s time to start prepping your ingredients. Make sure that you have a wide variety of items ready to go, such as meats and vegetables, fish, and other items that can be cooked on the flat top. You may also want to grab some oil or a high-heat cooking spray to reduce sticking.

Once you’ve prepped your ingredients, it’s time to start cooking! Start by adding your proteins to the flat top, using the highest heat setting. Once they are nicely browned, remove them and set aside. Next, add your vegetables, using lower heat if necessary, and cook until they are lightly browned.

Once your proteins and vegetables are cooked, it’s time to assemble your dish. Start by arranging your proteins and vegetables on a plate and add any sauces or marinades that you wish. Finally, top it off with your favorite seasonings, such as herbs and spices, to complete the dish. 

Preparing the Grill 
Now that you know how to use a flat top grill, it’s time to discuss the important step of preparing your grill. Before you even start your first cook, you want to make sure that the flat top is clean and oiled. This will prevent sticking and ensure that the food cooks evenly.

To clean the grill, use a soft-bristled brush to remove any debris and then use a damp towel to wipe away any clinging residue. Once this is done, use a high-heat cooking spray or oil to lightly coat the flat top and remove any leftover fluid from the last cooking session. 

Cooking Techniques 
Once the grill is prepped and ready to go, it’s time to move on to cooking techniques that will give your recipes flavor, texture, and all around yumminess. While there are many different techniques for grilling, here are a few that will take your flat top recipes to the next level.

First, make sure that you are using the right tools, such as a wide spatula, tongs, and thermometer to make sure you are cooking your food to the proper temperature and removing it from the grill safely. Also, experiment with different cooking styles, such as searing, roasting, and even smoking to create unique flavors and textures in your food. Finally, use a flavorful marinade to give your recipes depth and make them really pop. 

Cleaning and Maintenance
