<p style="font-size:21px">Does charcoal go bad? This question has crossed my mind many times, mainly the moment I am about to open the charcoal bag to grill for the first time in a while. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">No matter how many fuel sources humans come up with, charcoal will always remain the classic choice for <a data-lasso-id="9320" href="https://griddleking.com/sapporo-grilling-kits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grilling</a>. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Despite this favoritism, many people are actually unaware of whether or not charcoal expires.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">After all, lots of things expire, even things that aren't food. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Does there come a time when charcoal is no longer safe to use, simply because of how old it is? </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px"><strong>Simply put, no, charcoal does not expire due to the passage of time. However, there are some other scenarios we discuss below that may make charcoal a bit troublesome to use.</strong></p>

<p style="font-size:21px">In this article, we will cover the specifics of why charcoal does not expire.</p>

<h2>What Can Make it More Troublesome to Use?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">The main thing one needs charcoal to do for them is ignite. You need it to burn, and burn well. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Otherwise, it isn't going to do a very good job with pretty much anything that you need it for. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">While it will not expire over time (as in, it will not become completely unusable), it may become less efficient over time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">The first culprit for this can be the absorption of moisture over time. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">If it's is not stored in a very dry place, it can be exposed to moisture. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">When it is exposed to moisture, charcoal will not burn as easily. It's not even that the charcoal has to be wet. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">If it gets stored somewhere that water can get to it, it can seep directly into it over time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">It may even may have a tough time igniting and burning properly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">That's the second thing to keep in mind, even though charcoal itself may not expire.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"1px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:1px">That would be the case if it has any additives added to it that do expire.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Some charcoal has additives that help it burn better, and without it, said charcoal gets harder to use.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Ultimately, neither of these things make charcoal completely unusable, so it would be wrong to say that <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004JMZDB6?tag=griddleking01-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow sponsored noopener" data-lasso-id="9322" data-lasso-name="Kamado Joe KJ-CHAR Big Block XL Lump Charcoal, 20 pound" data-lasso-lid="15472">charcoal</a> in and of itself "expires." </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">However, it may become so inefficient over a long period of time that you would still be better off just buying new charcoal. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">That said, if you have an old bag lying around, there's no harm in seeing if it burns well still.</p>

<h2>About How Long Should You Keep Charcoal?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">OK, so charcoal doesn't necessarily go bad over time, it just has a chance of getting <em>less effective</em>. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">That being the case, how long should you bother keeping a bag it? </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Is there a certain point in time in which you would just be better off buying new charcoal? </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Well, it depends on what <a href="https://bbqchickenusa.com/types-of-charcoal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-lasso-id="9323">type of charcoal</a> you have and how you have stored it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">As mentioned previously, charcoal being exposed to moisture will reduce its effectiveness, sometimes quite significantly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">But what if you store it somewhere where moisture is not a problem? </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Somewhere where it is dry as a bone and never absorbs any moisture at all? </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Well, so long as you are using <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MZYCG0X?tag=griddleking01-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow sponsored noopener" data-lasso-id="9324" data-lasso-name="Original Natural Charcoal Hardwood Briquettes 2 X 100% Premium All-Natural Pillow Shaped Charcoals - Lights Easy, Burns Quickly, Adds Extra Flavor to Meats (7.07 lb.)" data-lasso-lid="15504">all-natural charcoal</a>, you could keep it effectively forever.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">It has to be all-natural because of the aforementioned additives situation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">If the additives go bad, the charcoal gets worse, and thee isn't much you can do to extend the life of the additives. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">But if you have no additives to worry about, moisture it's only enemy, and that means you could use it way down the line if it's kept dry.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">That could be a year, five, or even a decade (and potentially much longer). </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Depending on the quality of the charcoal you have, it may be more likely to crumble into small pieces over time (if it is low quality).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">But technically, those pieces will still be able to burn very well, they just won't be a good size for the job.</p>

<h2>How Can You Tell If Charcoal is Still Good to Use?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Yes, actually you can. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">If you are worried about the quality of your coal, you can use a chimney starter.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Though finding any suitable place to burn it works well enough and light some of the charcoal in question. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Once you do, you are going to want to watch how exactly it burns to determine if it is good to go or not.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">If it struggles to ignite at all, that's definitely a bad sign and you will want to grab a new bag. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">But even if it does manage to catch fire, that doesn't mean it's good to use. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">It may have trouble staying lit after it does catch fire, which is also a problem for cooking. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Even if it manages to ignite and stay lit, you'll have to see if it manages to burn evenly or not.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">If it burns unevenly and inconsistently, it could spell a disaster for your grilled meal. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">The sear could become uneven as well due to this, and that nice smoky flavor you want to get can instead become bitter and unsavory. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">So, needless to say, this is also something you don't want to happen.</p>

<h2>Can You Save Damp or Wet Charcoal?</h2>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Can you save it when it has gotten wet and possibly restore it to its former glory? </p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">But if it has only gotten a little damp, there may be something you can do for it. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">The easiest thing to do is lay it out on a baking sheet in direct sunlight for a few days. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">As long as it doesn't rain, this may make it usable again. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Just be sure to test the charcoal after this treatment to see if it really is worthy.</p>
