<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But before we ignite those burners and let the sizzle begin, there's a small yet significant detail to talk about: those mysterious Blackstone squirt bottles.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p class="is-style-info"><strong>Fast Facts:</strong> Blackstone bottles are designed for convenience and precision in griddle cooking, typically filled with oils or water. They allow for easy application of oil for seasoning the griddle, ensuring even cooking, and water for steam cooking or cleaning, enhancing both flavor and griddle maintenance.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why Blackstone Bottles Are Your Griddle's Best Friends</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When I first got my hands on my very own Blackstone griddle, I was like a kid with a shiny new toy. I couldn’t wait to throw on some steaks and flip some fluffy pancakes. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But I quickly realized that mastering the art of griddle cooking involves more than just food and flames – it’s about technique. And that’s where <a href="https://blackstoneproducts.com/products/2-pack-squeeze-bottles" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-lasso-id="11569">Blackstone bottles</a> come to play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In this post, I'm going to spill the beans on what goes into those bottles and share some personal stories about how these simple tools have elevated my griddle game.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>H2O: The Griddler's Secret Weapon</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first weapon in my Blackstone bottle arsenal is none other than good ol’ H2O. </p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Water for Cleaning</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A water bottle is indispensable for cleaning your Blackstone griddle between batches of food or even amidst cooking. Just a quick squirt and a scrape, you can say goodbye to the remnants of your previous dish, preventing flavors from mingling unwelcomely.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Water for Steam Cooking</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Moreover, water is your ally when you want to add a touch of steam to your cooking. I remember the first time I decided to steam some vegetables on the griddle. A dash of water followed by a dome cover, and voila! Gorgeous, brightly colored, perfectly cooked veggies emerged, with a little smoky griddle kiss.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Oils That Make Griddling Glorious</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There is more to the bottles than a simple answer like "oil". In fact, it goes deeper than you would think, but for simplicity purposes, lets look at the most obvious.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>High Smoke Point Oils for Seasoning</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to oils, I learned the hard way that not just any oil can take the heat. For seasoning my Blackstone, I stick to oils with high smoke points, like canola, vegetable, or flaxseed oil. These are perfect for that initial seasoning layer that protects your griddle and builds up a non-stick surface over time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Flavored Oils for Cooking</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For cooking, I favor a more flavorful approach. Depending on what’s on the menu, I might reach for a bottle of extra virgin olive oil for my Mediterranean dishes or sesame oil to bring an Asian touch. These oils not only prevent foods from sticking but also infuse them with aromatic goodness.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Homemade Marinades and Sauces</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Blackstone bottles are not just for cleaning and oiling; they house my homemade marinades and sauces. Whether it's a <a href="https://griddleking.com/bbq-bacon-jalapeno-sliders-on-the-blackstone/" data-lasso-id="11570">zesty barbecue sauce</a> for my ribs, a tangy buffalo concoction for wings, or a luscious garlic butter for seafood, these bottles keep my secret weapons within arm's reach. They allow for easy, controlled dispersing, making sure every piece of food is evenly coated in flavor town.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Vinegars for Zing</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then there's the world of vinegar. A squirt of balsamic can finish off a griddle salad with a flourish, while apple cider vinegar can tenderize and perk up a cut of pork. Oh, the power in these bottles!</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Broths and Stocks</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’ve discovered that keeping a bottle filled with chicken or vegetable broth handy can be a game-changer. Not only can you use it to deglaze the griddle, but you can also use it to prep a quick side dish like rice or quinoa right there on the flat top. This versatility is one of the reasons why griddle cooking has become my obsession.</p>

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Beer and Wine</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Believe it or not, a squirt of beer or wine from your Blackstone bottle while griddling can add a whole new dimension to your food. I've de-glazed bratwurst with beer and simmered shrimp in white wine, leading to some of the most mouthwatering dishes I’ve ever made. Plus, a swig for the chef makes the outdoor cooking experience all the more enjoyable!</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Great Burgerscapade</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of the funniest yet educational mishaps I had with my Blackstone bottles involved a backyard burger blowout. In my eagerness to serve up the juiciest burgers on the block, I got my bottles mixed up and squirted apple cider vinegar onto my patties instead of the oil. While expecting a sizzle, I got a hiss and an unexpected burst of tang. It was a misstep that turned into a culinary twist; the burgers had a subtle zing that my guests loved!</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Sunday Morning Pancake Perfection</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then there was the Sunday morning where I wanted to impress my family with perfect pancakes. I armed myself with a bottle of batter, another with butter, and a third with maple syrup. The control I had over the amount of batter poured led to uniformly sized pancakes, and the butter bottle provided a quick way to grease the griddle in between batches. The syrup bottle? Well, that was the icing on the cake – or, rather, the pancake.</p>
