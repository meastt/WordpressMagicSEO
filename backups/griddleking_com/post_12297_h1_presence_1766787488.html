<h2>Why Use A Propane Smoker?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Smoking meats has been a popular way of cooking food since the colonists first arrived in America, and they discovered that this was the way preferred by the Native Americans. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">They would use charcoal and cook the meats until they were soft, succulent, and delicious. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">In modern times, thanks to technological advances, one popular method of smoking meat is a propane smoker, which uses gas as its heating source. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Propane smokers have become popular as they burn much cleaner and more efficiently than charcoal burners, meaning there will be no ash or suit on your delicious meat. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Most smokers use a relatively simple design in that the gas burner is connected to a propane tank and sometimes even the natural gas line of your home. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Usually, there will be a shelf or area above the burner to place wood chunks or sawdust to get that <a href="https://griddleking.com/is-the-pk-grill-good-for-smoking-yes-its-awesome/" data-lasso-id="9519">authentic smokey taste</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">If you love to cook meat and host significant garden events at your home, you should think about investing in a propane smoker. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">They are efficient, convenient, easy to use, and you'll have everyone at your home in a state of bliss once the meat comes off the smoker. </p>

<h2>What To Look For In A Propane Smoker?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Before you run to the hardware store and pick up any <a href="https://griddleking.com/can-you-use-oil-drum-for-smoker-build/" data-lasso-id="9646">old propane smoker</a>, there are a few things that you should consider. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Each person is different when it comes to a smoker, and depending on how often you'll be using it and how much food you plan to cook with it, it can dramatically affect the style of the propane burner and the price. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">To make it a little easier for you, we have done plenty of research and will list below a few ideas you should consider before buying a propane smoker.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":9430,"width":616,"height":410,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img src="https://griddleking.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/7GzK69mk_G-1024x682.jpg" alt="popane smoker" class="wp-image-9430" width="616" height="410"></figure>

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>How Much Meat Can It Hold?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The most important factor to consider when buying a new propane smoker is the capacity or how much meat it can hold. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">If you are someone who cooks from time to time for a small family of four or five, then a smoker of around 800 square inches will be perfect for your smoking. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">If you are someone who enjoys hosting BBQ parties and you're looking for a smoker that will be able to cook high amounts of brisket, ribs, chicken, and pork, then you're going to want a medium-sized smoker that will give you around 1,200 - 1,600 square inches of cooking space. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>The Temperature Range</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">When it comes down to choosing a high-quality propane smoker, you should realize that they vary in heat output. <br>It's essential to recognize that the more heat output your smoker has, the easier it is for the smoker to achieve and sustain the right perfect for smoking meats.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Most propane smokers will work with either one or two burners, giving you a BTU of around 10,000 to 20,000. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">If you live in a colder state and your propane smoker is outside, it will require more power to stay at the optimal heat of around <a href="https://griddleking.com/can-a-gas-grill-get-too-hot/" data-lasso-id="9520">225 degrees</a>; thus, this is a major thing to consider. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>What Is The Smoker Made Of?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">While you wouldn't think the propane smoker's material would significantly affect the overall taste and efficiency, it certainly does. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">When it comes to the highest quality propane smokers, you want to ensure it's a mixture of cast iron and stainless steel. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">There are a few reasons why these materials are much better for propane smokers; a stainless steel frame will dramatically increase the longevity of your smoker as it resists rust and corrosion. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Within your propane smoker, you should find cast iron burners. Again, these will last much longer than cheaper materials and help optimal heat transfer. <br>The interior should be coated in stainless steel, not paint, as the paint will eventually crack, bubble, and fall off. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Does It Have Two Doors?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Having two doors on your propane smoker is an excellent idea, as it will ensure that your smoker maintains the perfect temperature.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Two doors on the front will include an upper one for the main compartment where the meat will be smoked, whereas the other will allow you to access the lower level of the smoker. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">This ensures that no heat will be lost in the upper compartment if you need to top up the heating element in the lower level of the smoker, such as the wood chip box or the water bowl.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Does It Have Something Other Propane Smokers Don't?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">When it comes to a great propane smoker, a few extra features others don't have can improve your smoking experience.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">A thermometer on the smoker's door is always a great addition, as you can keep an eye on your smoker's internal temperature to ensure your meat is cooking at the correct temperature. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Another great additional feature on some of the more extravagant smokers is a glass window which allows you to peek into the smoker to ensure that your meat is cooking nicely. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">More straightforward yet convenient add-ons include adjustable racks that accommodate meats of all sizes. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
