Step 1: Gather Your Supplies. Before you can season your flat top grill, you’ll need to gather a few items: vegetable oil, a soft cloth, a brush for scrubbing, and a heat source.

Step 2: Clean Your Grill. To ensure that you get the best results from your seasonings, you’ll want to be sure to thoroughly clean your grill before you start. Using a stiff brush and warm soapy water, scrub all the surfaces of your flat top grill, including the interior and exterior surfaces. Pay special attention to the edges, as they can be easily forgotten, but are essential for a successful seasoning.

Step 3: Pre-heat your Flat Top Grill. To properly season your grill, you should pre-heat it to a medium-high setting. This helps to open the pores of the metal, which helps to ensure that the oil is properly absorbed.

Step 4: Apply the Oil. Now it’s time to apply the oil. Using your soft cloth, apply a quality vegetable oil to all of the surfaces of your flat top grill. Be sure to evenly coat the entire surface and pay particular attention to the edges, as they will not be as easily reached by the brush.

Step 5: Wipe Off Residue. Once you’ve finished coating your grill with oil, use your soft cloth to wipe away any excess oil. This will help to prevent any build-up or smoke during the next steps.

Step 6: Place your Grill in The Heat. To finish the seasoning process, you should place your <a href="https://griddleking.com/flat-top-grilling-2/" data-lasso-id="10582">flat top grill</a> in a heat source, such as a barbeque grill or the oven. The heat will help to further open the pores of the metal and “bake” the oil into the surface, creating a non-stick cooking surface. Keep an eye on your flat top grill while it is in the heat, as you will want to make sure that it does not get too hot.

And that’s it! You’ve just seasoned your <a href="https://griddleking.com/griddle-cooking-temperature-chart/" data-lasso-id="10774">flat top grill and created a non-stick cooking</a> surface.

Now, before I end this guide, let’s quickly discuss the top oils for seasoning your flat top grill. Here’s a few of my personal favorites: vegetable oil, olive oil, and coconut oil. You can also experiment with different types of oils to find the one that works best for you.

That’s about all there is to it when it comes to seasoning your flat top grill. With proper maintenance and regular seasoning, your flat top grill should last for years to come. If you follow the steps and use quality oils, you should end up with a delicious, non-stick cooking surface.
