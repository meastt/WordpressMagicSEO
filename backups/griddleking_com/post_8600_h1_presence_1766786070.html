<p style="font-size:21px">As far as <a data-lasso-id="4204" href="https://griddleking.com/can-you-use-pyrex-inside-a-traeger-grill-smoker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grilling</a> goes, propane gas has always been the mainstay. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Recently, however, people have started seeing MAPP gas as a viable alternative. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">So, can you use MAPP gas on a p<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Weber-51060001-Q1200-Liquid-Propane/dp/B00FGEHG6Q?tag=griddleking01-20&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="nofollow sponsored noopener" data-lasso-id="4205" data-lasso-name="Weber Q1200 Propane Grill" data-lasso-lid="7724">ropane grill</a>? Yes, you certainly can, it is important to determine if MAPP is indeed a better option than the traditional propane option –and this blog will try to do just that.  </p>

<h2><strong>What is MAPP Gas?</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">MAPP gas <a href="https://www.differencebetween.com/difference-between-mapp-gas-and-map-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-lasso-id="5163">is created</a> using a combination of propadiene and methyl-acetylene, and has a wide number of industrial uses including welding and soldering. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">But, other than that, the gas can also be used to cook food, and a number of chefs around the world use MAPP to apply the finishing touch to steaks and many other kinds of foods. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h2><strong>Benefits of Using MAPP Gas:</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">As far as cooking goes, the main use case of <a data-lasso-id="4206" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07Q3DJQJ5?tag=griddleking01-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow sponsored noopener" data-lasso-name="BLUEFIRE MRS-7014A Trigger Start Gas Welding Propane Torch Head Specially for MAPP Fuel,Extend 1.5&quot; Burning Tube Nozzle Piezo Self Ignition Handhold Cylinder Soldering Brazing Triple-Point Flame" data-lasso-lid="15532">MAPP gas</a> is the cooking or searing of meats. However, this gas can also be used for BBQ's and grilling. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">In fact, people who do not want to use a propane cylinder simply decide to turn to MAPP gas. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">But, are there any benefits of using MAPP gas for <a data-lasso-id="4207" href="https://griddleking.com/should-you-flip-ribs-when-grilling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grilling</a>? Below are a couple of advantages that a grilling enthusiast can derive from MAPP:</p>

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><strong>Improved Flavor:</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">A major problem with propane gas is that it can sometimes cause the food to have a gassy odor which, obviously, is not desirable. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">On the other hand, MAPP does not transmit any extra smell or flavor to the final product. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">The most probable reason for this is the fact that MAPP gas burns at higher temperatures, which allows it to burn off every element. As a result, all by-products like residue or smell are effectively eliminated.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><strong>Higher Temperatures:</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Like we mentioned, MAPP gas burns at higher temperatures, and this is probably the number one reason that people prefer MAPP to propane. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Propane has a maximum temperature of around 3,600 degrees Fahrenheit. On the other hand, MAPP can reach temperatures as high as 5,500 degrees Fahrenheit. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Although these are both quite extreme temperatures, MAPP’s ability to burn hotter than propane, allows it to cook food quickly and more thoroughly. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">This is particularly beneficial for people who are in a rush, or for people who wish to cook or sear the meats in a particular manner. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>Benefits of Using Propane Gas:</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00B58A0QK?tag=griddleking01-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow sponsored noopener" data-lasso-id="4208" data-lasso-name="Cuisinart CCG-190 Portable Charcoal Grill, 14-Inch, Black" data-lasso-lid="15477">Charcoal grills</a> are still the go-to for many grilling lovers, but the fact is that <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01KJGBC6A?tag=griddleking01-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow sponsored noopener" data-lasso-id="4209" data-lasso-name="Char-Broil Portable 240 Liquid Propane Gas Grill" data-lasso-lid="15500">propane grills</a> outsell their charcoal counterparts quite comfortably. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Although charcoal imparts a distinctive flavor during grilling which is quite desirable to a lot of people, propane gas has its own set of unique benefits, which include:</p>

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><strong>Easy to Start:</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">One of the main reasons that propane gas is so desirable is that it makes it extremely easy and convenient to start a grill. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">The gas heats up very quickly, and can maintain the temperature considerably better than a charcoal grill.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Of course, this convenience and ease is also associated with MAPP gas, along with the added advantage of higher temperatures. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><strong>Inexpensive:</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Propane gas is available for quite cheap, which is why it has remained popular in the grilling world, for so long. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">This is also one area where propane outdoes MAPP, since the latter is considerably more expensive. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Also, several parts of the world have stopped producing MAPP gas. So, if you reside in one of these areas, your only option is to buy an MAPP-substitute, which might contain impurities. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><strong>Provides Better Control:</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Although the higher temperatures associated with MAPP might be desirable and attractive for certain cooking styles, this trait is not always beneficial. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">The higher the temperature, the harder it is to control the cooking process. Since propane does not burn as hot as MAPP, it offers greater control and stability. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">In fact, with MAPP gas, you could do most things right and still end up overcooking a piece of tuna or steak. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">This is due to the extremely high temperatures, which give you very little room for error or adjustment. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>Should you Use MAPP or Propane? Factors to Consider:</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Choosing between MAPP and propane is not always a straightforward decision, and is one that depends on what your grilling or cooking objectives are. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Propane is certainly much less expensive and widely available than MAPP. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">So, if you are a frequent griller and want to minimize your grilling expenses, then propane might be the right choice for you. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">On the other hand, MAPP burns at higher temperatures and can therefore allow for quicker and more thorough cooking. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":8617,"width":744,"height":553,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img src="https://griddleking.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/mapp-gas-vs-propane-main.jpg" alt="mapp-gas-vs-propane-when-grilling" class="wp-image-8617" width="744" height="553"></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">MAPP gas can therefore provide a more fulfilling cooking experience, which is why it is often preferred by chefs and other seasoned cooks wanting to implement sophisticated cooking techniques. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Other than that, unlike propane, MAPP does not leave off an undesirable taste or smell. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Safety is another area where propane trumps MAPP. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">The higher temperatures involved in MAPP present a greater hazard, particularly for newbie cookers who do not have much experience with hot flames. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Indeed, MAPP is even capable of burning off metals like steel and aluminum, which is why non-expert cooks tend to steer clear of the gas. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Propane, as we mentioned, offers greater control and stability, which means it does not present as much of a safety risk as MAPP. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Since it burns at lower temperatures, propane is also unlikely to melt off other metals that come into its path. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>Wrapping Up</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"15px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:15px">To some up, for a large proportion of people, grilling is more of a hobby than a profession – and, for those people, we feel that propane gas is the better fit. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"15px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:15px">The only key advantage of MAPP gas is that it cooks quicker and does not leave a gassy residue. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"15px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:15px">When you pit that against the fact that propane is inexpensive, widely available, is quick and easy to use, and provides greater control, you cannot help but see propane as the clear winner in this debate. </p>
