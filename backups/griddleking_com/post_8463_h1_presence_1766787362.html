<h2>What Happened To The "Old" Blackstone Outdoor Pizza Oven?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Previously, there was a stand-alone oven , however, <strong>it was discontinued.</strong> </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Since the old Blackstone Pizza Oven was discontinued, many people have been wondering where they could find a one, or at least<em> why </em>it was discontinued. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">We put on our detective hats and put together a great resource to tackle the topic of <a href="https://griddleking.com/blackstone-pizza-oven/" data-lasso-id="3988">What Happened To The Blackstone Pizza Oven</a>. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>The Ovens Design</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">The Blackstone Pizza Oven Insert is designed to take up as little space as possible and yet still perform at the same capacity as any other pizza ovens of any size. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">The shape is mostly rounded at the corners and edges for safety reasons and portability. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Its mostly black exterior is meant to match all other products with the Blackstone brand. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">You can look up other products in Blackstone's lineup and see that a wide variety of them exist and share the same look and feel.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">By searching up "Blackstone griddles," you will find that there are several grills that would be a compatible fit for this pizza oven outdoor add-on. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">The smallest and cheapest one I could find was one measuring in at twenty-two inches and costing one hundred and ninety dollars. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">From what we can see in these results, the larger the surface area of each griddle, the more that grill will cost compared to one that has a smaller surface area. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Another factor that can contribute to the cost would be the additional features that come with the grill such as its own set of legs that do not require the grill to always be set on a tabletop and a set of side tables that allow the backyard chef to place other ingredients and utensils on while cooking.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->

<h2><strong>See How the Pizza Oven Insert Works</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Of course, being an "add-on" product, you will need an actual grill made by Blackstone if you wish to utilize this pizza oven. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">It cannot cook that favorite pizza of yours all on its own. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Before you purchase the Blackstone Steel Outdoor Pizza Oven Add On, you will first need a Blackstone griddle that has a tabletop size of at least twenty-two inches. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Otherwise, the cover has no use outside of sitting somewhere and collecting dust. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">I mean, if you just wish to spend two hundred and thirty dollars on this thing just because you think it would make a nice centerpiece for your living room, who am I to stop you? </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Of course, you can also use a propane tank that holds up to twenty pounds of fuel. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">If you desire that level of gas power, then you will also have to purchase a bulk tank adapter -- which is sold separately. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Unfortunately, this device does not run on electricity or any other power that is safer for you and the environment. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Be sure to purchase enough propane for your Blackstone Pizza Oven insert and to store it in a safe place where it can avoid catching fire or falling from a high distance.</p>

<h2 style="font-size:35px"><strong>Cooking On The Patio Oven</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">One great plus to having this specific pizza oven attachment is the speed at which the device cooks your pizza. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">This baby will have your pies fully cooked in as little as two and a half minutes! </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">This is possible thanks to the pizza cooking technology patented that uses two large stones in the heating process. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Both of these stones are made of cordierite with one being in the shape of a rectangle and the other taking on a more rounded shape. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">This cooking technology combined with the surface area of the grill that the oven is attached to will allow you to cook some of the most tender and crispy pizzas from up to <strong>fifteen inches in diameter</strong>. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Whether it be a personal pan pizza or a pie meant for the whole family, this oven has your back.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Let us suppose that you are hosting a pizza dinner where everyone designs their own personal pizzas with their preferred toppings, sauces, and spices. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Rather than having them wait for their dishes to be ready in twenty minutes or so as one would with a standard pizza using a standard home oven, they could have their personal pizza finished and ready to eat in less than three minutes! </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">With the speed at which it cooks the pizzas, you could have twelve fully cooked personal pan pizzas in not even half an hour. Not only will it be delicious, but it will also be efficient.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>A Pizza Oven You Can Take Anywhere!</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">This oven is an attachable and detachable add-on for the standard Blackstone grill. This makes transporting the device much easier and more convenient.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">There may come times when you are more in the mood for burgers and hot dogs rather than pizza. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">When those times do come, simply remove the oven attachment from the grill and get grilling. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">You might even have a friend who has one and wishes to borrow your pizza oven attachment for a neighborhood pizza night. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">The light weight of this pizza oven add-on comes in at around fifty pounds, so transportation is more than easy -- especially with the durable industrial handles on both sides that resist heat and protect those strong hands of yours.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">When fully assembled, the dimensions of the oven measure thirty-one inches in length by twenty-seven inches in width by sixteen inches in height, (each measurement rounded to the nearest inch, of course). </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">When it is not attached to the grill, the pizza oven can be easily stored on a shelf or somewhere on the floor where no one will trip over it. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">As sturdy and compact as this device is, be sure not to have anyone use it as a sort of stepping or sitting stool.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>This Outdoor Pizza Oven Gets Hot!</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">The Blackstone Steel Outdoor Pizza Oven Add On has some amazing and impressive heating capabilities. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Just like most other ovens of greater size, this little attachment has the capacity to heat up a pizza that measures up to five quarters of a foot in diameter to crisp and tender perfection. Do not be fooled by its smaller size. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Of course, it will still need the grill <em>and </em>propane. With these two things, the interior of the oven can reach up to <strong>700 Degrees Fahrenheit</strong>, which is more than enough for any pizza! </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">If you do not believe it, just check the thermometer that is built into the pizza oven. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">For safety, the heat will be trapped by the front sliding door while the smoke vents through the top of the oven through the smaller openings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">As a warning, though, if there are small children nearby while the device is being used, be sure to keep them from touching any part of the grill and oven. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Kids can be very curious and want to put their hands on anything that intrigues them -- even if that thing has an extremely high temperature. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Not all kids know such things at such an early age. I am sure that at a safe enough distance they could stand by and watch the oven work its magic without risking their healthy skin. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">I remember being around three years old and taking hold of a metal cookie pan right as my mother pulled it out of the oven. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">I would not want that for any young child and I hope that you will take all necessary precautions in keeping those youngsters safe.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h2><strong>Blackstone Delivers Pizzas With Authentic Taste</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">If you crave the authentic taste and texture of a pizza made in the Italian style, then this is the product for you. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Any kind of pizza with any kind of toppings, sauces, or spices can be made with this pizza oven attachment and its primary components. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Just like the grill on its own, the pizza oven works terrifically outdoors and serves as a great cooking center for any gatherings of friends and family. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">I mean, sure, you could definitely order your pizzas by the box like most people do. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">However, that rare, authenticity that comes from a fresh pizza does not come from many places -- especially if you do not live in a bigger city. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">With the Blackstone Steel Outdoor Pizza Oven Add On, you can enjoy that authenticity whenever and with whomever you desire.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">I often visit my aunt and uncle when they host a pizza dinner for whatever occasion. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">They have their very own brick pizza oven in their backyard where they can cook any sort of pizza we make for ourselves when the heat is just right. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">With this oven add-on, however, it will <em>not</em> be necessary for you to build your own pizza oven from brick and mortar. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">As long as you have the right griddle, you, too, can begin cooking once the heat is just right.</p>

<h2><strong>Oven Pricing</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">For an exact price on this product, the Blackstone Pizza Oven attachment will cost two hundred and twenty-seven dollars -- not including tax or shipping fees. </p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Walmart also offers the option of purchasing a limited warranty period that lasts one year after your purchase in case something happens to the oven. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">If it ceases to function properly or if it somehow receives a decent amount of damage that prevents it from cooking as well as it ought to, you can send the pizza oven back and claim your replacement if your warranty is still in effect. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
