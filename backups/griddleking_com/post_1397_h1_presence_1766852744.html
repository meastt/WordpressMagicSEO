<p>Discovering mice droppings near your griddle is never a welcome sight. As a griddle owner myself, I've researched and tested various methods over the past two years to keep these unwelcome guests away from our beloved griddles. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Whether you have a Blackstone Griddle or any other brand, the presence of mice is not only a health hazard but also a safety concern, as they can carry diseases and pests. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, I'm here to share my tried-and-true strategies to keep your griddle mouse-free, ensuring that when you're ready to cook, your griddle is as pristine as your passion for outdoor cooking.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Understanding the Attraction</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>First things first, let's talk about why mice might be drawn to your griddle. Much like us, mice are attracted to food and the scent of cooking. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Residual grease and food particles that may be left behind after a grilling session are practically an open invitation for mice to come and explore, and once they find a reliable food source, they're likely to return or even set up shop nearby.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">An Ounce of Prevention</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Keep It Clean</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My number one rule for keeping mice away from the griddle is simple: cleanliness. After every grilling session, once the griddle has cooled down, I don a pair of gloves and give it a thorough scrub. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cleaning not only prevents mice but also ensures that your food tastes its best every time you cook. It's important to remove every bit of food residue, no matter how small. I find that a mixture of water and vinegar is not only effective but also a safe cleaning solution.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Cover Up</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After cleaning, always cover your griddle. I use a heavy-duty, weather-resistant cover that fits snugly around my griddle. This creates a physical barrier that discourages mice and other pests from exploring. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On several occasions, before I had this cover, I found evidence of mouse visits, which was not a pleasant discovery before a big cookout, let me tell you.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Store It Right</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you're not planning to use your griddle for an extended period, <a href="https://griddleking.com/how-to-store-an-outdoor-griddle/" data-lasso-id="11579">store it</a> in a secure location, like a shed or a garage. My griddle spent the winter in my garage last year, and when I brought it out come spring, it was as clean as I left it, with no signs of mice at all.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">When Mice Outsmart Prevention</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Even with the best preventive measures, sometimes mice can still find their way to our beloved griddles. Here's what worked for me when I had to step up my game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Natural Deterrents</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Peppermint Oil</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Turns out mice aren't fans of the smell of peppermint. Who knew? I put a few drops of peppermint oil onto cotton balls and placed them around my griddle storage area. It's a natural and safe method, and it gives everything a nice minty smell.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Particular scents are designed to keep mice at bay either by suffocating them or just making the air unbearable. Recommendable scents for mice repelling include: </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Cloves </li>

<li>Mothballs </li>

<li>Peppermint </li>

<li>Ammonia </li>

<li>Camphor </li>

<li>Cat fur</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Predators</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No, I don't mean that you should release a cat or an owl into your backyard (though if you have a cat, they can be mighty helpful). I installed a couple of owl decoys around my grilling area. It seems to have an effect because sightings – and signs – of mice have dropped down since they were put up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Not-So-Natural Remedies</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Mousetraps</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sometimes you need to resort to the old-fashioned way. Mousetraps placed strategically around the griddle when it's not in use can catch any pesky intruders. I make sure to check and clear the traps regularly – preferably daily.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Ultrasonic Repellents</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These high-tech gadgets emit a frequency that's unpleasant to mice but inaudible to humans. I tried one of these after a neighbor recommended it, and it seemed to make a difference. Be aware though, it's not a one-and-done solution, and effectiveness can vary.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Poison is ONLY a Last Resort</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Use poison only if you have exhausted all other options and are prepared to deal with the aftermath. Remember, poison should be used with extreme caution, especially in homes with children or pets, and let's not forget we are cooking our food here. So, poison is a crappy option in all honestly.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Grydlmat: The Quick and Easy Solution For Griddle Mice Prevention</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The <a href="https://www.grydlmat.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-lasso-id="11580">Grydlmat</a> is this super handy mat that fits nearly any griddle, and it's a total game-changer for keeping your griddle in top shape. Think of it as a year-round guard against all the messy stuff – it's made of this really tough, food-grade silicone, but it's still flexible and easy to use.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What's cool about it is the bottom. It's got this polished surface that sticks to your griddle when it's clean, cool, and just a bit oily. This means no more bugs, dirt, or rust getting on your griddle. It's like a protective shield that's always on duty.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The high walls on the Grydlmat are a neat touch too. They trap all the gunk and moisture, so when it's time to cook, you just lift off the mat, and voilà – a clean griddle ready to go. No more scrubbing before every BBQ session.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In short, the Grydlmat is like that reliable buddy for your griddle – it's there to make sure your griddle stays clean and lasts longer, so you can focus on the fun part: grilling up some great food.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Big Picture</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Remember, keeping mice away from your griddle isn't just about the next time you cook; it's about ensuring that your equipment lasts longer and stays in top condition. Rust, chewed cables, and contamination from mice can ruin a griddle and abbreviate its lifespan dramatically.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My takeaway from my experiences is that diligence and routine are your best friends in the quest to keep your griddle mice-free. It might seem like a lot of effort at first, but once you've made it part of your grilling ritual, it's just another step toward perfect backyard barbecues.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Sharing the Wisdom</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lastly, I've learned that sharing these tips with my fellow outdoor cooking aficionados is paramount. After all, what's the point of gaining all this knowledge if not to help others in their own backyard grilling adventures? Sometimes, it's about more than just the food we cook; it's about preserving the joy and the pride we take in our grilling—and keeping our griddles free from uninvited critters is an essential part of that.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, the next time you fire up the griddle, take a minute to remember that prevention is key, and if you have mouse trouble, know that you're not alone. </p>
