If you are a fan of cooking, then you have likely given some thought to the importance of having a seasoned griddle. It is not necessary for every dish, but it is an essential component to creating delicious meals as well as following proper grilling and cooking food safety standards. Whether you are a novice or an expert in the kitchen, understanding the importance of a seasoned griddle and why and how to season a griddle for optimal cooking results will take your cooking game to the next level!

Let’s dig into “The Importance of a Seasoned Griddle: What it Looks Like, 

Home chefs in-the-know already get it, we are talking about adding some flavor and character to your griddle game. A season griddle, simply put, is a griddle that has been treated with oil and heat to create a non-stick surface; a bit like those delicious, golden-browned pan-fried potatoes. A similar treatment is also established with woks and cast-iron pots to help create crunchy stir-fries, which helps us appreciate the powerful advantages of seasoned cooking surfaces. 

What is a Seasoned Griddle and Why is it Important? 

A seasoned griddle is a flat metal cooking surface, typically made of aluminum or steel, that has been coated with oil and heated to create a non-stick layer. This non-stick layer provides numerous benefits to cooking over a traditional, non-seasoned griddle.

One of the primary benefits of using a seasoned griddle is the improved cooking results it provides. Using a well-oiled griddle or pan, as opposed to a dry pan, will aid in evenly cooking food, help prevent sticking of food, and add a beautiful sear or char.

Another benefit is adding flavor to your dishes. The oil used to season the griddle helps create flavor notes to the dishes you cook. Additionally, this flavor will improve and enhance as the griddle ages and more of the oil is incorporated into the pan.

Lastly, a seasoned griddle is very easy to clean. The nonstick coating not only helps prevent food from sticking, but also aid in the cleaning process. There is no need for harsh detergents or scrubbing to remove cooked-on food; a simple rinse or swipe with oil or an oil-dampened cloth is usually all that is needed. 

The Benefits of a Seasoned Griddle 

There are many advantages to having a well-seasoned griddle. Aside from the amazing flavor, which is hard to replicate on a non-seasoned griddle, there are a myriad of benefits that a seasoned griddle brings to the table.

The most obvious benefit is the improved cooking results. A well-seasoned griddle distributes heat evenly, which helps reduce burning and sticking, and speeds up the cooking process. Additionally, it produces a beautiful sear, or char, that adds an extra layer of flavor to your dishes.

A well-seasoned griddle is also incredibly easy to clean. Since it creates a non-stick surface, food does not adhere to the griddle, making it a breeze to keep neat and ready for the next meal. Instead of scrubbing off cooked-on food, a simple wipe or rinse of the griddle is usually enough to prepare it for its next culinary task.

Lastly, a seasoned griddle will last a very long time. With some regular care, a seasoned griddle can last for years and years. 

How to Season a Griddle for Optimal Cooking Results 

Now that you know why it’s important to have a seasoned griddle, let’s review how to properly season a griddle.

The first step to the seasoning process is to clean the griddle. Using warm, soapy water and a stiff-bristled brush, scrub down the griddle to get rid of any grease or debris that may have built up on the surface. Once it is clean, dry the griddle with a paper towel or cloth.

The next step is to apply oil to the griddle. Start with a generous amount of a neutral oil such as canola or vegetable, and spread it in a thin, even layer over the entire surface. Once the entire surface is covered in oil, <a href="https://griddleking.com/the-temperature-chart-for-griddle-cooking-know-your-heat/" data-lasso-id="10220">heat the griddle to a medium-high temperature</a> (roughly 375˚F). Allow the griddle to preheat for 15-20 minutes and then turn off the heat. Finally, use a paper towel or cloth to wipe off any excess oil.

Once you have completed the seasoning process, it is important to remember that this should be done with every use. Once you are finished using the griddle, simply wipe off any food debris, apply a thin layer of oil, and turn the heat off.
