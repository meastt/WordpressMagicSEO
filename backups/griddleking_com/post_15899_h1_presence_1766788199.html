<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Griddle Heat Zone and How To Use Them To Your Advantage</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Flat top grills have a large, flat cooking surface that allows for even heating and cooking. One of the <a href="https://griddleking.com/the-flat-top-grill-cooking-temperature-chart-the-key-to-perfect-heat/" data-lasso-id="10446">key advantages of a flat top grill is the ability to use different heat zones to cook</a> different foods at the same time. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The heat zones on a flat top grill are typically divided into three sections: the hot zone, the warm zone, and the cool zone.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The hot zone is located at the center of the grill and is the hottest part of the cooking surface. This is where you can sear meats, cook pancakes, and other foods that require high heat. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The warm zone is located on the outer edges of the hot zone and is slightly cooler. This is where you can keep cooked foods warm while you finish cooking other items. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Finally, the cool zone is located on the outer edges of the grill and is the coolest part of the cooking surface. This is where you can keep foods warm without cooking them further.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">To use the heat zones to your advantage, start by preheating the grill on high for 10-15 minutes. Then, adjust the <a href="https://griddleking.com/blackstone-griddle-temperature-chart-know-your-heat-zones/" data-lasso-id="10447">heat as needed to create the desired temperature zones</a>. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">For example, if you want to cook pancakes in the hot zone and keep bacon warm in the warm zone, turn down the heat in the warm zone while leaving the hot zone on high. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">This will allow you to cook both items at the same time without burning the bacon or undercooking the pancakes.</p>
