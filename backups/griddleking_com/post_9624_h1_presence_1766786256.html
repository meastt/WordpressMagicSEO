<p style="font-size:21px">The answer to this question is that some Weber grill models can be built into structures, while others cannot.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Currently, the company offers two models that can be built-in – the Summit S-660 and S-460. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Both these models are available in both natural gas and propane versions and have been designed exclusively for in-built structures. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">If you decide to build into a Weber model other than the S-660 or S-440, the company voids the warranty on its grills. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">This is because the other models have not been optimized for built-in use. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Therefore, the company cannot be sure if they are safe to be built into and how they will behave with in-built structures. </p>

<h2><br><strong>How Long Does Assembling a Weber Grill Take?</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Using just manual tools, assembling a Weber grill should take you somewhere between an hour to 90 minutes. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">If you utilize a power screwdriver, you can get the job done considerably faster (somewhere around 40 to 50 minutes). </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Once you have completed the assembly, you will require another 10 to 20 minutes to clean up all the recyclable cardboard. </p>

<p style="font-size:21px">However, the difficulty level will vary on the grill model that you opt for. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Some models come with around a dozen parts, while others arrive with hundreds of components that need to be put together. </p>

<p style="font-size:21px">Alternatively, you can opt for a drop-in grill – the average for a drop-in grill will be similar to that of a built-in one, but the price range will be between $800 and #$2,500. </p>

<h2><strong>What Are the Benefits of a Built-in Grill?</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Compared to stand-alone grills, built-in grills tend to be bigger. Other than that, a built-in grill often includes countertops that can be used during food preparation. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">In addition, you will be able to store your <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0723FXC74?tag=griddleking01-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow sponsored noopener" data-lasso-id="6282" data-lasso-name="HOMWE Cutting Boards for Kitchen - Chopping Board 3-Pack w/ Different Sizes and Non Slip Handles - Reversible, Large Cutting Board Set - Unique Gifts for Cooks Who Have Everything - Gray" data-lasso-lid="15507">chopping boards</a>, utensils, and anything else that you need, right next to your grill. </p>

<h2><br><strong>Can the Weber iGrill 3 be used on any Grill?</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
