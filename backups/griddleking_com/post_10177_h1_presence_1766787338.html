<p style="font-size:21px">Looking for a grill for your truck hitch? You're not alone. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Being able to unload your grill and cook wherever you feel like is a liberating experience.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Many grills and smokers can be loaded onto the back of a truck, stored inside an SUV, and then used on the tailgate.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">There is a difference between that and a grill that is designed to fit on the truck tow hitch!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">The grill for a truck hitch is designed to fit onto the standard 2" hitch and has a frame that folds out when the <a href="https://griddleking.com/can-a-gas-grill-get-too-hot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-lasso-id="8368">grill</a> is needed and then folds away once the grilling is done. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">The grill is securely attached to the truck or SUV and provides a sturdy, safe outdoor cooking platform.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Grills that fit the truck hitch are superbly convenient and safe to transport as they don't shift around in the cargo area and don't take up extra space inside.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">So, his leaves more room for luggage – and one of the best examples of these are the Hitchfire grills.<br></p>

<h2><br>Who Are Hitchfire Grills </h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">The Hitchfire grill comes from the Tepui, specializing in rooftop tents, and became available on pre-order around September 2020. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Their idea was to create an outdoor grilling system that could attach to the tow hitch rather than the commonplace clamp-style grills.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h2>Why Hitch Grills Are Safer And More Convenient </h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">The biggest concerns around the clamp-style grills were safety.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">That if not adequately secured, those blazing hot grills and the food could capsize and cause injury or create a fire and spill your food everywhere.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">The other concern was the inconvenience of storage and packing the unit as if you were heading out on an adventure with a group of people.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">You would need to have a good-sized grill to accommodate the food volume required.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">This would mean a larger grill, with either gas or coal, taking up valuable space in the trunk or the cargo bay.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Plus it would need to be securely strapped down to avoid it coming loose during transit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Grills that utilize a metal tubing frame and connect to the tow hitch are far more solid, safe, and sturdy than clamp-mounted grills or tailgate grills. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Plus, they offer the convenience of a fold-out grill and don't require the grill to be placed on the tailgate or cargo bed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Now, let's explore the <a href="https://griddleking.com/hitchfire-adventure-grilling/" rel="nofollow sponsored noopener" target="_blank" data-lasso-id="8652" data-lasso-name="HitchFire | Adventure Grilling" data-lasso-lid="10975">HitchFire Grills</a> in more detail.</p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><br>Setting Up The Hitchfire Grill </h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">All of the components for the grill are included, and setting it up was quite simple. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">The arms of the grill are made from heavy-duty steel, and it fits the standard 2" fitting and is secured by a large bolt. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Doing this is better with two people so that one can bolt and the other can hold, but one person can do it with a bit of patience.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">HitchFire has ensured that the setup of this grill is easy, and kudos to them for designing it to make the layout simple and convenient. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">This already demonstrates that they have considered the customers' needs and taken steps to deliver a first-class product.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Then it was time to attach the grill itself.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">By following the instructions, you should have no difficulty assembling the grill and attaching it to the metal frame with the supplied pins and bolts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Another innovation that HitchFire offer is that the arm can be adapted to the 1 ¼" hitch provided the adapter can stand the grill weight. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">This can be exceptionally useful when you have a bike rack or an oversized tailgate. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>The Hitchfire Will Block Rear Sensors</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">One of the downsides of attaching the grill was that if you have rear sensors on your vehicle, the Hitchfire grill will interfere with or even block them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">This means that you may need to shut them down while you are traveling or have to deal with the constant beeping! </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">The other consideration is that the grill can obstruct the view of your license plate. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Still, fortunately, Hitchfire has considered this and offers hardware that allows you to mount the license plate on the swingarm.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">So you don't incur any unwanted interest from Highway Patrol or other traffic enforcement agencies.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>How Big Is The HitchFire Forge 15 Grill </h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">This grill offers 355 sq inches of cooking space and has dimensions of  39" X 13" X 21", so it is pretty compact.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">On the other hand, the HitchFire Forge 20 measures 42" X17" X 23" with the same cooking area as the Forge 15.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">The difference between the two is the burners. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Whereas the Forge 15 has two 7500 BTU gas burners, the Forge 20 has two 10000 BTU gas burners. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">In essence, the two grills are very similar in size.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":10199,"width":683,"height":455,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img src="https://griddleking.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Start-%E2%80%98Adventure-Grilling-HitchFire-F-20-Vehicle-Mounted-Grill-Review-1024x683.jpg" alt="can-you-grill-on-a-truck-hitch" class="wp-image-10199" width="683" height="455"></figure>

<h2>HitchFire's Fold Out Tables Are Ingenious</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">One of the intelligent elements of The <a href="https://griddleking.com/hitchfire-adventure-grilling/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow sponsored noopener" data-lasso-id="8655" data-lasso-name="HitchFire | Adventure Grilling" data-lasso-lid="10975">HitchFire Grill</a> is the fold-out tables that come with the unit. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">One of the significant challenges with outdoor or adventure grilling is to have suitable tables that can hold cooking accessories or food once the cooking is done.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">The Forge 15 has two built-in fold-out tables measuring 13" X 10 ½" and can easily support the weight of plates of food, drinks, or cooking accessories.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Once folded out, they are easy to access, and it makes the outdoor cooking experience that much easier and less challenging than other outdoor grills. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Plus, you don't need to pack extra tables and so you can save space in the load bay or trunk.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">HitchFire has also recognized that not everyone wants to use their grill still attached to their vehicle, so the Forge 15 can also be a tabletop grill. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">It has rubber feet so as to keep it stable and prevent slipping while being used, so versatility and flexibility come included!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>HitchFire Forge 15 – Durability During Transport </h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">With any outdoor grill, the durability will be tested, but with one that fits on the tow-hitch, will it be strong enough to withstand the bumps and jumps of rough terrain?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">HitchFire has done their homework on this aspect, and the grill remains securely locked while in transit and doesn't wobble or shake under the stress of moving over rough terrain.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">The lid has a lock that keeps it in place while driving and using rugged latches, pins, and screws to lock the frame in place keeps the whole unit secured regardless of the terrain.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Suppose you are traveling over particularly bumpy roads. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">It may be a wise idea to stop and ensure that the grill is still secure as you may find some loosening of pins or screws under all the shaking.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">But the securing system is generally excellent and should remain solidly in place for hundreds of miles.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h2>The HitchFire Forge 15 – Fuel Supply &amp; Temperature Management </h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">The Forge 15 uses two 16 oz propane tanks that fit onto each side and screw into place as a portable grill. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">This grill does not have a fuel gauge, so having more than one tank would be advisable to ensure you don't run out of fuel.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">With a proper adapter hose, you could also use a 20-pound propane tank.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">You would not have the tanks connected while driving, but installing them is pretty simple.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Since you have two burners, you can use each for different foods if you need to. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Each has its own temperature control, so keeping food warm on one while cooking full burn on the other is a great benefit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Speaking of temperature control, this unit works better when both burners are used. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">While the single burner does reach around 400F on pre-heat, the grill loses temperature much faster when the grill is opened with the single burner than with both in operation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">The grill reached 500F in the same pre-heat time with both burners and maintained its temperature far better than the single grill. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">With the burners on high, you need to be aware of flare-ups as the flames will lick up around the edges of the burner.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Even with the drip trays in place, the higher temperatures can cause flare-ups.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">At mid-temperature, the grill is still very hot, and this reduces the risk of flare-ups while cooking, so if you don't need to run the burners at maximum, rather don't.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Cleaning The HitchFire Grill </h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">The only catch with cleaning the HitchFire grill was removing the grease tray at the back as it is held in place by a tab that can be tricky to release.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">But cleaning it was pretty easy once it was out. As an idea, line that grease trap with <a href="https://griddleking.com/can-you-use-aluminum-foil-in-a-pellet-grill/" data-lasso-id="9669">aluminum foil</a> to make that part of cleaning easier.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Once the grill has cooled off, you can scrub down the grill using a steel brush and remove any leftover food particles from the bottom of the grill.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">One concern is the accumulation of dust during transport.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">If you don't have the cover sold separately, you may find a layer of dust on the outside and inside when you finally stop, but this is easily cleaned off. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">As with most grills, you will need to do a deep clean eventually.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">But that can be done once the grill has been used for a few months; in the meantime, wiping it down after each cooking session will be more than sufficient.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>The HitchFire Forge 15 – Price </h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Overall, this is a phenomenal piece of gear! It is solid, robust, and durable and delivers excellent performance in every area. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">When it comes to the price, many may feel that at $549, this is on the expensive side, which, if you only got the grill, it would be.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">But you need to remember that you are getting the swingarm included, which more than justifies the price. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">While other grills may have slightly less space and cost less, they don't offer the swingarm attachment.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">This allows the HitchFire to go wherever you go without the inconvenience of taking up cargo space.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">If you are someone that enjoys a lot of outdoor cooking and you can save space and set up the grill quickly and with ease.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Plus get an excellent build quality and innovative design, then an investment of this type will pay good dividends over the lifetime of the grill.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Hitch Smokers </h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">We have covered the Hitcfhire Grill, but are there smokers that can hitch to your truck available? </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">The answer is yes, there are, so let's look at some of those.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Smokers are generally bigger with more cooking space.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">So when we look at a smoker like the Basic Tailgater from Johnsons Custom Smokers or Gator Pit's range of hitch <a href="https://griddleking.com/best-budget-smokers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-lasso-id="8370">smokers</a>, you will get a lot more space for a lot more money!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">And if you thought the Hitchfire Forge 15 was expensive, you ain't seen nothing yet!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Gator Pit Hitch Grills And Smokers </h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Gator Pits of Texas offers two models in 24" grill only and a 30" smoker/grill.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">These offer 480 sq inches of cooking space on the 30" smoker and 384 sq inches on the 24" grill. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">They have 10" legs with heavy-duty wheels for any terrain and come complete with the hitch adapter made with a ¼" thick wall and 2" square tubing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">These are not as compact as the Hitchfire, but Gator Pits has made them tough and durable and can be used as <a href="https://griddleking.com/best-portable-pellet-grills-and-smokers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-lasso-id="8371">grills</a> or smokers. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">It has a temperature gauge included, removable heavy-duty charcoal, wood, and food grates.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">It also has a grease drain with a cap to make it easier to remove the grease after cooking.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">You can also lock the pit onto the truck to prevent it from being stolen, and considering the price of this unit, that may not be a bad idea!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">The 24" Gator Pit sells for $2595.99, and the 30" smoker version is cheaper at $2395.</p>

<p style="font-size:21px">This is a monster of a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000URBBVK?tag=griddleking01-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow sponsored noopener" data-lasso-id="8372" data-lasso-name="Camp Chef Smoke Vault 24&quot; Vertical Smoker, Body Dimensions 24 in W x 16 in D x 30 in" data-lasso-lid="15468">smoker</a> and offers 6 square feet of the total cooking area! </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">It fits a standard 2" hitch, and the gas-assisted design means you can grill on coal one day and smoke with gas the next! </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">That will be enough to feed a small crowd at a football game!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p style="font-size:21px">This pit is designed not to affect the paint on your vehicle when at temperature.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">It uses a standard reverse flow design but has been custom engineered to remove hot spots inside the pit. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">This ensures even heat distribution and smoke flow throughout the cooking chamber.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Another great idea here is that the stacks have rain caps for some additional weather protection.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">The unit is made from 3/16 steel making it heavy, but not too heavy, and it can be easily carried and maneuvered by two men.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">This unit is also pricey at $2175 but certainly brings a lot to the table! </p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">If $2000 truck grills arent your thing, a good alternative to the Hitch Fire is both the PKGO and NOMAD Grills. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px"><a href="https://griddleking.com/are-pk-grills-worth-the-money/" data-lasso-id="8656">PK Grills </a>(Portable Kitchen) is a family owned business based out of Arkansas and their grills are Made in America! But, its not just that that makes them special. </p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Additionally, the PKGO can smoke, sear or anything in between thanks to its exceptional heat retention and 4-vent top-to-bottom airflow system.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Finally, you can use the PK Flip Kit and turn your PK into a convertible and DOUBLE your cooking space for a large group. </p>
