<p><br>When shopping for a griddle for a glass top stove, there are several factors to consider. One of the most important factors is heat conduction. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since glass is an insulator, it won’t conduct heat as well as other materials, like cast iron or aluminum. It’s best to choose a <a href="https://griddleking.com/7-reasons-blackstone-griddles-are-worth-it/" data-lasso-id="10012">griddle</a> made from a material that can handle higher temperatures and distribute heat evenly. <a href="https://griddleking.com/stainless-steel-vs-cast-iron-griddles/" data-lasso-id="10013">Cast iron</a> and aluminum are great materials for this because they both have excellent heat conduction.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><br>It’s also important to choose a griddle that is the right size for your stovetop. Most griddles are either square or rectangular and come in various sizes. You want to make sure the griddle is large enough to cover your stovetop but not so large that it hangs off the edges.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><br>Finally, you’ll want to take a look at the features and added benefits the griddle offers. For example, some griddles have a lid, which can be helpful when cooking particular dishes, while others are reversible and can be used as a griddle or a flat-top.</p>
