To achieve the maximum benefit from seasoning your flat top, there are a few simple steps you should take as you season it. Here’s what you need to do. 

The first step is to prepare the grill surface. This means scrubbing off any grease or food particles that have built up on the surface. If you have any stubborn spots, use a wire brush to scrape them away. Once the surface is completely clean, you’re ready to start seasoning.

The next step is to apply the seasoning. Start by applying a generous layer of cooking oil to the surface. Use a brush and coat the entire surface evenly, making sure to get all sides and corners as well. Then, sprinkle a layer of course-ground salt evenly across the surface. Use a paper towel to spread and spread the salt evenly.

Once the surface has been coated in oil and salt, preheat your flat top on the highest heat setting for about 15 minutes. The heat helps activate the seasoning and will help it to bond with the surface. Make sure not to leave it on for too long or else you’ll risk over-caramelizing the seasoning, which can lead to a burned-tasting crust.

Once the seasoning has fully formed a crust, turn off the heat and allow the flat top to cool. Once cooled, give the surface one last wipedown with a paper towel dipped in oil, and you’re done!
