If you are using fig wood to <a href="https://griddleking.com/how-to-grill-without-smoke/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-lasso-id="3613">smoke</a> food for the first time, it is best to start with small pieces so that you can experiment with the flavor. </p>

<h2><strong>Hickory</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to smoking meats, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01J6DX238?tag=griddleking01-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow sponsored noopener" data-lasso-id="3616" data-lasso-name="Smoak Firewood s Cooking Wood Chunks (Competition Grade) USDA Certified for Smoking, Grilling or Barbequing (Hickory 25-30lbs 1728 Cubic in.)" data-lasso-lid="15498">hickory</a> is one of the best woods you can use. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you're looking for a wood that will give your smoked meats a delicious flavor, hickory is a great choice.</p>

<h2><strong>Mesquite</strong> </h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Many people think of mesquite as a thorny shrub that invades their landscaping. However, this hardy plant is also the key to perfect smoked meats. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000NV6HOE?tag=griddleking01-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow sponsored noopener" data-lasso-id="3617" data-lasso-name="Traeger Grills Mesquite 100% All-Natural Wood Pellets for Smokers and Pellet Grills, BBQ, Bake, Roast, and Grill, 20 lb. Bag" data-lasso-lid="15466">Mesquite</a> is one of the best woods for smoking meats because it provides a unique flavor that pairs well with both light and heavy cuts of meat. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The wood itself is dense and takes longer to ignite than other types of wood, which means it provides a long, steady smoking process. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This slow burning also allows mesquite to impart a deep, rich flavor to meats without overpowering them. As a result, mesquite-smoked meats are always moist and full of flavor. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Whether you’re cooking chicken or pork, brisket or ribs, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000NV6HOE?tag=griddleking01-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow sponsored noopener" data-lasso-id="3618" data-lasso-name="Traeger Grills Mesquite 100% All-Natural Wood Pellets for Smokers and Pellet Grills, BBQ, Bake, Roast, and Grill, 20 lb.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>Oak</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Oak is another excellent choice for smoking meats. This durable hardwood is known for its ability to burn hot and slow, which is perfect for smoking meats. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07R8VMDWX?tag=griddleking01-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow sponsored noopener" data-lasso-id="3619" data-lasso-name="Zorestar Oak Smoker Wood Chunks, BBQ Cooking Natural Wood Chunks for All Smokers, 15-20 lbs" data-lasso-lid="15534">Oak</a> also has a strong flavor that can stand up to the boldest of barbecue sauces.

<h2><strong>Mixing Fig with Other Woods</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Many people believe that the type of wood used for smoking meat is a matter of personal preference. However, some woods are better suited for smoking than others. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fig wood, as you know, imparts a delicious and fruity flavor to meats that can enhance their taste. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When <a href="https://www.virtualweberbullet.com/all-about-smoke-woods/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-lasso-id="3620">mixed with other types of wood</a>, fig wood can help to create a more complex flavor profile. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For example, if you’re determined to create a mouth-watering smoky barbecue chicken dish, consider mixing your fig wood with something complimentary such as pecan or maple. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Additionally, fig wood burns slowly and evenly, making it ideal for use in <a href="https://griddleking.com/best-camping-kitchen-grill-griddle-pellet-smoker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-lasso-id="3621">smokers</a>. For these reasons, fig wood is an excellent choice for smoking meats. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is also important to note that you should only use dried fig wood, as green wood can impart an unpleasant flavor to the food. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>What Woods Should You Avoid?</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Although there are many different types of wood that can be used for smoking, there are just as many (and probably more) that you should avoid using in your smoker. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It can be dangerous to use woods heavy in sap and oils, as these tend to ignite quickly and can become dangerous when enclosed in small spaces (like inside your smoker). </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You not only risk unintentionally incinerating your meal, but chemicals may be released when the wood is burned, which can be dangerous to your health if inhaled or ingested. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some woods to avoid include pine, eastern cedar, spruce, cypress, sycamore, redwood, and more. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It may be tempting to find wood from your own backyard, but only do so if you’ve done your research and determined it to be safe. It’s always best to find a reputable manufacturer when in doubt. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now you know that fig wood is an excellent choice for smoking meats, but it can be overpowering if too much is used. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s important to only use dried wood, as green wood can impart an unpleasant flavor. When mixed with other types of wood, fig wood can help create a more complex flavor profile.</p>
