<p style="font-size:21px">Deciding what's the best way to cook while camping can seem daunting. Do you go for a versatile griddle, a classic grill or something more specialized like a pellet smoker? </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Here we take a look at the pros and cons of each option to help make your decision easier. Happy camping!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">As someone who owns all three, I can tell you they each have their pros and cons. Some require power that might not be readily available when you are camping. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">On the other hand, the Forest Service rules or camping region you are in might prohibit open flames (yes, even for cooking). </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Even with all of those variables, some folks jus prefer certain types of food and flavors that not all devices can produce. If you are someone who loves smoked food, a griddle might not be your go-to. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">So, lets lay out the pros and cons, talk some prices and logistics and help you determine what type of camping cooker is best for you, a griddle, a grill or a pellet smoker. </p>

<h2>Start With Your Personal Preferences</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Here’s the deal, I can go on and on about which grill is going to be “best for camping” but none of what I say matters if it doesnt fit into your personal preferences. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">So, let’s start right off the bat with your personal favorites. Are you someone who loves rich smokey flavors that only a smoker can create? </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Well, then a charcoal grill or pellet smoker might be best for you. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Do you love cooking multiple things at once and overall cooking versatility? Well then, a griddle might be right up your alley! </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Take a minute and just think to your self about what you personally like, and then, the rest of this advice in this article will resonate a bit better with your preferences in mind. </p>

<h2>A Quick Word on Packing Space</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Any grill, griddle or smoker you buy will need to meet your personal cargo and storage requirements. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">All of the products mentioned today are about as small as you can get without going for a tiny backpackers stove. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">If you truly dont hav the room for these types of grills we recommend today, then consider something like the FireDisc or a Skottle. They are perfect for packing up VERY small but delivering big meals with big flavor. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Read more about FireDisc and RTIC Skottles <a href="https://griddleking.com/rtic-king-disc-vs-recteq-firedisc-compared-review/" data-lasso-id="2349">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Knowing Your Camping Area Rules</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">My family and I recently wanted to escape the Wyoming winters and we headed south to Texas to visit the Guadalupe Mountains National Park (and the warmer temps). </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">I packed my PKGo Charcoal Grill and Smoker (which BTW, if you dont know about PK Grills, check out our review here). </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">The first night at the National Park campground, I was so excited to smoke up some<a href="https://griddleking.com/how-to-cook-frozen-burgers-on-a-griddle-or-flat-top-grill/" data-lasso-id="2350"> juicy prime rib burgers</a>. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">I fired up the coal chimney and once the coals were right, I dumoped them into the PKGO and was juuuuust about to toss the <a href="https://griddleking.com/grilling-hack-adding-an-ice-cube-to-your-burger/" data-lasso-id="10599">burgers on the grill</a> when I was greeted by a Park Ranger who advised there were NO Open Flames Allowed. Bummer. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">The park ranger was polite, but still, no grilling when camping? Yes, that can be true when the climate is dry and burn risks are elevated. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">So, lesson learned and fine avoided, but it left me thinking, what type of grill could I have brought? </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Turns out, according to the park ranger, I was able to use the little camp stoves with the 1-lb green propane bottles. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">I’ll just have to ignore the fact that those also create an “open flame”. Oh well, I dont make the rules. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">To make my long winded rant faster, heres the deal: Know the rules where you are camping and that might quickly make your decision for you. </p>

<h2>Grills For Camping</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">When it comes to the types of grills for cooking food while camping, there are a few different options to choose from. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">You could build a fire and cook your food directly over the flames, or you could bring along a portable grill. A charcoal <a href="https://griddleking.com/grilled-pineapple-the-ultimate-guide/" data-lasso-id="10659">grill is a great option if you're looking for that classic campfire flavor</a>. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">If you're looking for something a little more convenient, however, a propane or electric grill might be a better option. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Portable grills are easy to set up and take down, and they make it easy to cook your food without having to deal with the hassle of building a fire. </p>

<h3>Charcoal Grills For Camping</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">A charcoal grill is the best option for cooking food when camping for several reasons. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">First, charcoal grills cook food using an open flame, which imparts a delicious smoky flavor to meat and vegetables. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Second, charcoal grills are typically more portable than gas grills, making them easier to transport to and from a campsite. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Finally, charcoal grills are less expensive than gas grills, making them a more budget-friendly option for campers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">For all these reasons, a charcoal grill is the best choice for campers who want to enjoy great-tasting food while spending time in the great outdoors.</p>

<h3>Gas Grills For Camping</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">When it comes to cooking while camping, gas grills have a lot of advantages over other methods. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">For one thing, they're pretty easy to set up and take down, which is always a bonus when you're trying to pack light. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Plus, you don't have to worry about lugging around charcoal or firewood - all you <a href="https://griddleking.com/1lb-propane-tanks/" data-lasso-id="9951">need is a small canister of propane</a>. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">As far as the actual cooking goes, gas grills give you much more control than, say, building a campfire. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">You can adjust the temperature quickly and easily, so you're less likely to burn your food. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">All in all, gas grills are just way more convenient than any other option when it comes to cooking while camping.</p>

<h2>Electric Grills For Camping</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">When it comes to cooking while camping, electric grills are the way to go. For one thing, they're much easier to set up than traditional charcoal grills. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">All you need is a source of electricity, and you're good to go. Plus, electric grills are generally easier to cook on, since you can control the temperature more precisely. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">This means that you're less likely to end up with burnt or undercooked food. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">And cleanup is a breeze with an electric grill - no more scrubbing charred food off of a dirty grate. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">So, if these pros and cons are up your alley, then the next time you camp, ditch the charcoal and go electric. </p>
