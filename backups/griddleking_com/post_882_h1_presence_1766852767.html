<p class="has-medium-font-size">I once heard some guy on YouTube say "My griddle can do everything your grill can do and about 100 things your grill <em>can't </em>do". I gotta, say, I agree! </p>

<p>When you're packing for the wild, you want gear that can pull double (or triple) duty. Enter the griddle. It's not just for pancakes, folks. </p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The griddle is a one-stop cooking wonder, making it a no-brainer when you're limited on space and don't want to lug around the entire kitchen.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Put it this way, a little camp stove needs extra pots and pans, can only cook 1 thing at a time (for the most part) and is pretty limited in capability. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Choosing Your Camping Griddle: What to Look For</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Sure, anyone can throw together the "best of" and list a bunch of griddles, but let's be honest, we want to know WHY we want to pick said griddle. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">So, let's look at the features and designs that help us pick the right griddle for each of you.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="fuel-power-source">Heat Source Compatibility: Fire, Gas, or Electric?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Consider the heat source you'll be using. Many griddles are designed for open fires, but I've got a soft spot for the convenience of a propane-powered camp stove. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Griddles come in two different power sources as their means of heating the cooking surface. The most common is LP Gas (otherwise known as Propane). Propane <a href="https://griddleking.com/how-to-store-an-outdoor-griddle/" data-lasso-id="770">griddles are of the more common outdoor</a> griddles. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The other type of power source for a <a data-lasso-id="771" href="https://griddleking.com/can-you-use-griddle-on-electric-stovetop/">griddle is electricity</a>. I had previously only used propane griddles, but just recently Blackstone introduced a new indoor-use approved electric griddle in the new E-Series Blackstone 17 and 22-inch griddles. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some can even run electric for those "glamping" trips where you have the luxury of a power source. The first time I hooked up a griddle to my camper's outdoor kitchen, it felt like cheating – but in the best possible way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Material Matters: Cast Iron vs. Aluminum</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Griddles come in all shapes and sizes, but the material can really make or break the deal. Cast iron, with its stellar heat retention and durability, is a classic choice.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">A cold-rolled/cast-iron cooking surface will require a seasoning process, if you are unsure what that is, check out our guide here<a class="rank-math-link" data-lasso-id="775" href="https://griddleking.com/how-to-season-your-new-griddle/"> Easy Griddle Seasoning Guide</a>. Keep in mind, some <a data-lasso-id="776" href="https://griddleking.com/do-blackstone-griddles-come-pre-seasoned/">griddles come pre-seasoned</a> and others require a seasoning before the first use, so check with your owners manual before jumping into the seasoning process. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size"><a href="https://griddleking.com/does-blackstone-make-a-stainless-steel-griddle/" data-lasso-id="777">Stainless Steel</a> and Aluminum Titanium do not require a seasoning process before use. Personally, I like the seasoning process of a new griddle or when inventing a neglected griddle. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Aluminum griddles are lighter and heat up quickly, making them friendly for the backpacking types. However, they can be a bit fragile and won't give you that lifelong companionship a cast iron buddy offers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Size and Portability: Matching Your Griddle to Your Adventure</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Think about where your outdoor adventures will take you. If you're car camping, you've got the luxury to go big. On one starry evening, I had a larger-than-life griddle that let me cook up a feast for my entire hiking crew. Talk about being the campsite hero!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, if you're trekking into the backcountry, you’ll need something lightweight and compact. There was this one time I overestimated my carrying capacity and lugged a griddle that was way too big up a trail. My back paid the price, but lesson learned: match your griddle to your journey.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":17862,"width":"561px","height":"auto","sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img src="https://griddleking.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/griddle-insert-for-charcoal-grills-starter-kit-flat-top-griddle-steelmade-527305_1200x-1024x1024.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-17862" style="width:561px;height:auto"></figure>

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Heat Distribution: The Griddle's Secret Weapon</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One glorious morning, I was on a mountain, griddle at the ready, the air crisp and the campfire crackling. What happened next was nothing short of magic. I poured out some pancake batter, and it cooked evenly - no burnt edges, no raw middles - just pancake perfection. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That's when I truly understood the power of a good griddle's heat distribution. It's all about that even cook, and boy does it make a happy camper.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="griddle-cooking-surface-real-estate">Griddle Cooking Surface Real Estate</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The amount of real estate you get to cook on is what I refer to as the "cooking surface real-estate". </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">For each make and model, this will vary but for a quick eyeball reference when shopping, the cooking surface real-estate will be oftentimes designated in the model description. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">In my own experience, I have found the Blackstone Adventure 17 to be a great balance of size and capability as a go-to griddle for camping. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="burner-element-size-and-btu">Burner Element Size and BTU</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">This is a make or breaks it for some people. Heating elements matter and how well the <a href="https://griddleking.com/can-you-use-crisco-to-season-a-griddle/" data-lasso-id="778">griddle or flat-top grill handles heat is a big deal</a> especially for the budding backyard chef. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">BTUs are an acronym used for the measurement of heat named the British Thermal Units, I'm no engineer but you can read more here if you want to nerd out on <a aria-label="BTU's (opens in a new tab)" class="rank-math-link" data-lasso-id="779" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_thermal_unit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BTUs</a>. Bottom line, the higher the BTU rating, the <a data-lasso-id="780" href="https://griddleking.com/4-hacks-to-make-blackstone-griddle-hotter/">hotter</a> it gets! </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Something to consider with BTUs is propane usage thats associated with the burner size and heat rating.  The higher the BTU, the more propane will be consumed by the <a data-lasso-id="781" href="https://griddleking.com/how-to-clean-griddle-after-cooking/">griddle while cooking</a>. </p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Heavyweight Champion: Lodge Pre-Seasoned Cast Iron Griddle</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lodge is the name in cast iron, and their pre-seasoned griddle is no exception. It's rugged, reliable, and gets better with age – just like a fine wine. Mind you, it's heavy, so it's best for places where you won’t be moving camp each day. The one I have has seen countless sunrises and is still going strong.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Lightweight Contender: GSI Outdoors Bugaboo Non-Stick Griddle</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now, for those long treks where every ounce counts, GSI's Bugaboo is a game-changer. Lightweight and non-stick, it's been a back-saver. It doesn't hold heat like cast iron, but for a quick meal of eggs and toast, it's perfect. It's not the heirloom piece, but it's fabulous for when weight and space are at a premium.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The All-Rounder: Camp Chef Professional Fry Griddle</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This one is a sweet spot for me. Camp Chef makes solid gear, and their professional fry griddle hits the mark. It's got heat diffuser plates to minimize hot spots, and the size is ideal for feeding a crew without breaking your back carrying it. It fits nicely over two burners on most camp stoves. I've had one for years, and it's a trusty companion for car camping shenanigans.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Unexpected Hero: Blackstone Adventure Ready 17 Table Top Grill - Portable Gas Griddle</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is my first griddle and i still use it to this day. The Blackstone Adventure Ready 17 Table Top Grill has been a lifesaver when the weather's uncooperative, or I’m just feeling a little lazy. It's great for large families on the go, and the convenience of the incorporated gas means you're cooking in no time. Plus, the clean-up is a breeze, which means more time enjoying the wilderness.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Maintenance and Cleaning: Keeping Your Griddle Happy</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally, don't forget about upkeep. Cast iron requires a bit more TLC with seasoning and careful cleaning. I’ve spent many a night, post-feast, gently cleaning and oiling my cast iron so it's ready for the next round. Non-stick and stainless steel options might be easier to clean but behave differently when it comes to cooking certain foods. Always choose what you're willing to take care of, because a happy griddle means happy eating.</p>
