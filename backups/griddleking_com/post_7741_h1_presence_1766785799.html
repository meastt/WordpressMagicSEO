<h2><strong>How to Grill Without Smoke</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">There are a few different ways that you can <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07C9CFNKG?tag=griddleking01-20" data-lasso-id="2397" rel="nofollow sponsored noopener" target="_blank" data-lasso-name="Power XL Smokeless Electric Indoor Removable Grill and Griddle Plates, Nonstick Cooking Surfaces, Glass Lid, 1500 Watt, 21X 15.4X 8.1, black" data-lasso-lid="15518">grill without smoke</a>. The first way is to use a covered grill. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">If you have a covered grill, simply close the lid, and the smoke will not escape. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">This is a great option if you're grilling something small like chicken breasts or hamburgers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">If you don't have a covered grill, you can still grill without smoke by using a pan. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Place your meat in a pan and set the pan on the grill. This will help to prevent the smoke from escaping. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">If you are having trouble with both of these methods, you can try using a chimney starter. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">A chimney starter is a device that helps to start your charcoal without using lighter fluid. Once the <a href="https://griddleking.com/how-far-should-charcoals-be-from-grill/" data-lasso-id="2398">coals are hot</a>, you can place them on the grill and start cooking.</p>

<h2><strong>How to Stop the Grill From Smoking</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">If your grill is still smoking, even after using one of these methods, you may need to adjust the temperature. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">If your grill is too hot, it will produce a lot of smoke. Try turning the heat down a bit and see if that helps to reduce the amount of <a href="https://griddleking.com/why-does-my-griddle-smoke-so-much-4-easy-fixes/" data-lasso-id="2399">smoke produced</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">You may also need to clean your grill or barbecue pit. Grease and fat can cause your <a href="https://griddleking.com/why-does-bbq-smoke-follow-you/" data-lasso-id="9575">grill to smoke</a>, so make sure to clean it regularly. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Also, make sure that you are using the correct type of charcoal. Briquettes are the best option for grilling without smoke because lump charcoal produces a lot of smoke.</p>

<h2><strong>How to Cook with Indirect Heat</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">If you're still having trouble grilling without smoke, you may want to try cooking with indirect heat. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Indirect heat is a method of cooking that uses two different zones of heat. The food is cooked over the indirect heat, while the <a href="https://griddleking.com/how-far-should-charcoals-be-from-grill/" data-lasso-id="2400">coals are placed on the other side of the grill</a>. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">This is a great option for larger pieces of meat, like a ham or a whole chicken. Here are some more tips on how to cook with indirect heat.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Place the food over the unheated part of the grill. Make sure that your grill is clean and free of grease buildup. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">If your grill has multiple burners, turn off all but one of them. Close the lid and let the food cook for the recommended amount of time. Check the food regularly to make sure that it is cooking evenly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">If the food is done before the coals are, move the food to the heated part of the grill and let it finish cooking. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">When you're finished cooking, make sure to clean the grill thoroughly. This will help to prevent future smoke problems.</p>

<h2><strong>How to Keep Your Grill Clean</strong> </h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">One of the best ways to prevent smoke from your grill is to keep it clean. So, make sure you clean the grill after every use. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">This will help to prevent grease and fat from building up. Also, use a grill brush to clean the grates. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">This will help to remove any food residue. Don't forget to clean the inside of the grill with a damp cloth. Be sure to dry it thoroughly afterwards to prevent rust.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">If you have a gas grill, clean the burners regularly. This will help to ensure that they are working properly. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Also, store your grill in a dry place. If it's stored in a humid area, it will be more prone to rusting.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">If you have any questions, consult the owner's manual. This will provide more specific instructions on how to clean it. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"21px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:21px"><strong>But remember: if the smoke is still a problem, you may need to adjust the temperature or try a different type of charcoal.</strong></p>
