<h2><strong>What Causes Grease Fires in Grills?</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A grease fire in a grill is caused by the accumulation of fat and oil on the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09QHVN9TJ?tag=griddleking01-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow sponsored noopener" data-lasso-id="3338" data-lasso-name="Criditpid Grill Grates Replacement for Charbroil 463436215, 463436214, 463436213, 463441514, 463420508 Models, 16 7/8&quot; Heavy Duty Cast-Iron Cooking Grids for Backyard Grill BY14-101-001-02." data-lasso-lid="15567">grill grates</a>, in the firebox, or in other areas of the grill. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over time, these substances build up and cause the grill to become coated with a flammable film of oil and <a href="https://griddleking.com/how-to-dispose-griddle-grease/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-lasso-id="3339">grease</a>. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When the grill is turned on and reaches a certain temperature, the heat from the flames causes this film to ignite, resulting in a grease fire. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The best way to prevent a grease fire is to keep the grill clean. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Be sure to clean the grates and grill after each use, and scrub them with a stiff brush to remove any stubborn stains. </p>

<p>By taking these simple steps, you can help prevent a dangerous grease fire from occurring.</p>

<h2><strong>How to Prevent Grease Fires </strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://griddleking.com/how-to-grill-without-smoke/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-lasso-id="3341">Grilling</a> is a great way to enjoy the outdoors and cook up a delicious meal, but it's important to be aware of the risks of grease fires. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Grease fires occur when liquids or fats catch fire, and they can be very dangerous. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you're grilling with oil or fat, it's important to wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water after handling raw meat. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This will help to remove any grease that could potentially catch fire. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You should also avoid putting any garments that have been stained with grease near the grill, as they could easily catch fire too. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Most importantly, preventing grease fires can be done by keeping your grill clean. Make sure to take the time to thoroughly clean your grill after each use. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Remember to scrape and burn off all the residual grease. By taking these precautions, you can help to prevent a grease fire from ruining your cookout.</p>

<h2><strong>How to Put Out a Grease Fire </strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If a grease fire does occur, it's important to take quick action to <a href="https://www.dixonbros.com/putting-out-a-grease-fire-on-grill/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-lasso-id="3342">extinguish the flames</a>. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Never use water to put out a grease fire, as this will only spread the flames. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Instead, turn off the heat source if possible and cover the flame with a metal lid or baking soda. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can also use a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07B9BNN24?tag=griddleking01-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow sponsored noopener" data-lasso-id="3343" data-lasso-name="First Alert HOME2PRO Rechargeable Compliance Fire Extinguisher UL rated 2-A:10-B:C, Red" data-lasso-lid="15517">fire extinguisher</a> to put out the fire, but that (along with baking soda) will almost certainly ruin your meal. </p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If the fire is small and contained, you may be able to smother it with salt or flour. Once the fire is out, you may need to clean your grill before returning to cooking. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If the grease fire is contained within the grill and your food is removed from the grill, it might also be easiest to simply let the fire burn itself out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In any case, it's important to take quick and decisive action to put out a grease fire, as indecision might lead to the fire growing beyond your control. </p>

<h2><strong>Should You Clean a Grill or Burn Off the Grease?</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As you probably already know, cleaning a grill can be a time-consuming and tedious task. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You have to scrub away all that caked-on grease, and it's often difficult to reach all the nooks and crannies. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition, <a href="https://www.delish.com/kitchen-tools/cookware-reviews/g32945021/best-grill-cleaner/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-lasso-id="3344">cleaners</a> can be expensive. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You may need to use harsh chemicals to really get your grill clean. However, taking the time to clean your grill regularly can extend its life and prevent rusting. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The other option is to simply burn off the grease after each use. This is a quick and easy way to clean your grill, but it does have some drawbacks. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For one, it's not as effective at removing all the grease as cleaning with soap and water. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Burning off the grease can be dangerous if you're not careful. If you do choose to burn off the grease, be sure to do so outside and away from any flammable materials. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you're short on time or patience, then burning off the grease might be the way to go. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, if you want to take extra care of your grill (and avoid any potential fires), then cleaning it thoroughly is your best bet.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
