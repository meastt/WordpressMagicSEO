<p style="font-size:21px">Previously, Grilla Grills operated as a metal processing company in Michigan, during which time it worked in the construction and automotive industries. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Naturally, then, <a href="https://griddleking.com/grillagrills/" rel="nofollow sponsored noopener" data-lasso-id="5879" target="_blank" data-lasso-name="Grilla Grills Chimp Portable Wood Pellet Grill with Alpha Connect" data-lasso-lid="8714">Grilla Grills</a> has always used the finest and most robust materials for all its products. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px"><strong>The short answer is that Grilla Grills are made in China. However, the business is still owned by an American family, and has been around for over four decades now. </strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Back in the day, the business stuck to stamping, pressing, welding, and cutting steel. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Gradually, though, it started looking for ways to diversify –and after numerous sit-downs at the drawing table, Grilla Grills came into existence. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Grilla Grills, for the first three years, completely manufactured its <a href="https://griddleking.com/best-portable-pellet-grills-and-smokers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-lasso-id="5880">pellet grills</a> in the USA. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">The distributors and dealers were excited at the idea that Americans would love to purchase products that were fully made in their own country. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">However, once customers learned about the high prices, they decided to go for one of the cheaper, imported <a href="https://griddleking.com/can-you-use-a-charcoal-grill-on-grass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-lasso-id="5881">grill</a> options. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">The sellers felt that the product was still excellent, but something needed to be done about the price. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">After that three-year mark, Grilla Grills had two options: they could either kill the grills off, or find a way to lower the manufacturing expenses. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">At this point, a team of Grilla <a href="https://griddleking.com/grill-or-griddle-for-rv-and-campers/" data-lasso-id="9717">Grills representatives traveled</a> overseas to see if there was a manufacturer who could help the business reduce its manufacturing costs. </p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">The business eventually signed a deal with a Chinese grill manufacturer. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">This, of course, was not an easy decision, but needed to be done for the survival of the product. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Shifting the product overseas, and eliminating the dealers or ‘middlemen’ from the process allowed Grilla Grills to save a great deal of money. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">This money was then funneled towards further enhancing the quality of the grills. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">The business improved the construction process, and turned it dual-wall to create a more effective thermal jacket. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Certain aspects of the grill were strengthened, which improved the grills’ longevity and durability. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Today, the entire line of Grilla Grill products contains more stainless steel than it has done ever before. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">These days, the extra hardware and other accessories for the grills are manufactured in Holland, Michigan. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">The business is always coming up with new products that are usable with its grills. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">These products are being shaped using laser cutters, and are being tested by avid grillers across the country. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Even though the core manufacturing might have moved overseas, Grilla Grills has never compromised on quality – the company opens up and assesses every grill that makes its way over from China. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">The reduction in price and increase in quality has led to a more than tenfold increase in Grilla Grills’ sales.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">The company has sold more grills in the last three months than it did during its first three years in operation. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">This, of course, also means that the customers are wholeheartedly approving of the new grills. </p>

<h2><strong> Wrapping Up:</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">So, to sum up, Grilla grills are manufactured in China, but that has only resulted in benefits for both the business as well as for its customers. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">In addition, the company is still owned and run by a family based in Holland, Michigan, USA. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">Despite shifting manufacturing overseas, quality of the product has not been compromised in any way. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":21} -->
<p style="font-size:21px">If anything, the savings in manufacturing and dealership costs have allowed the business to dedicate more money towards enhancing the quality of the grills while simultaneously lowering prices. </p>
