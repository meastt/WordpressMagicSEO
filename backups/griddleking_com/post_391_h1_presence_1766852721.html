<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Select a Cooking Oil: </h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"22px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:22px">Oh boy, this is a controversial topic! Depending on who you ask, you will be told all sorts of things about what the “best” <a href="https://griddleking.com/how-to-cook-frozen-burgers-on-a-griddle-or-flat-top-grill/" data-lasso-id="484">cooking oil is to use on a griddle</a>. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"22px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:22px">While many of the options you hear will be good, the reasons are generally people’s own bias in their ways. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"22px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:22px">Now, me being the Griddle King, I like to think I know a thing or two about the “best” cooking oil, but again, it’s a bias issue. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"22px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:22px">So I won’t tell you which is the “best” but I will tell you which cooking oils to consider. When selecting a cooking oil for a griddle surface, you want a cooking oil with a high smoke point.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"22px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:22px"> Also, you want a oil that will help create that slick layered coating that helps keep your griddle slippery like grandmas old cast iron pan. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">What Is The Best Cooking Oil For A Blackstone Griddle? </h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"22px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:22px">Now, this is a controversial topic! Some will swear by grape seed oil and others will say you need whatever their favorite is. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"22px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:22px">What matters is that you find a good quality cooking oil that has a high smoke point and good taste. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"22px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:22px">The oil you select for seasoning will affect the food taste as the oil binds to the cooking surface in the seasoning process. </p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"22px"}}} -->
<ul style="font-size:22px"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Grape Seed Oil:</strong> One of my personal favorites that leaves a nice compliment of taste couples with a high smoke point of 450 degrees Fahrenheit. </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Avocado Oil:</strong> A excellent choice for searing meats and for those meat eaters out there as the Avacado Oil carries as the smoke point at a blistering 520 degrees Fahrenheit!</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Olive Oil:</strong> A classic go-to for grandma’s cast iron and carries a smoke point of 40o degrees Fahrenheit. </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Flaxseed Oil:</strong> Another great option that does wonders for creating that slick surface seasoning but has the lowest <a data-lasso-id="486" href="https://griddleking.com/how-to-smoke-on-a-griddle/">smoke</a> point of 225 Fahrenheit. </li>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Season Your Griddle!</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"22px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:22px">Yes, you MUST season your griddle (assuming its cast iron or certain stainless steel models, check the manual). This is a step that cannot be ignored. Well, I guess it could, but it would ruin your cooking experience and leave you wondering why people love griddles so much. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"22px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:22px"><strong>The fact is, a seasoning of your griddle is just as important as having gas for your griddle, without either one, your food will suck.</strong> </p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">5. Learn Your Griddles Heat Zones</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"22px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:22px">Cooking on a <a href="https://griddleking.com/7-reasons-blackstone-griddles-are-worth-it/" data-lasso-id="489">griddle</a> is a blast and to be honest, there isn’t much your griddle cant do…..however, like all things, you need to learn your new griddle quirks just like anything else. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"22px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:22px">One area to learn and learn before you cook on your griddle, is where your <a data-lasso-id="490" href="https://griddleking.com/4-hacks-to-make-blackstone-griddle-hotter/">griddles heat</a> zones are. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"22px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:22px">What is a heat zone? Well, I don’t know if it’s even called a "heat zone", <strong>but here is what it basically is: </strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"22px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:22px">A heat zone is an area of heat on your griddle surface and what temperature that portion of the griddle carries. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"22px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:22px">Because under the griddle surface is multiple burners and there is space in-between the burner areas. Now because of this, you will have varying temperatures all over the griddle surface. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"22px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:22px">If you don’t familiarize yourself with these heat zones BEFORE your start your first feast, you may end up over-cooking some areas and under-cooking others. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Get a Laser Temperature Gun</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"22px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:22px">The best way to learn your heat zones is with an infrared temperature gun. Don’t let the name scare you away, they are safe, cheap, and easy to use. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"22px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:22px">Just point it at the different areas of your griddle surface while it’s hot and you will see what areas offer different heat zones. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"22px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:22px">I recommend using a laser temperature gun and measuring all areas of the griddle surface. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"22px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:22px">You will want to take these measurements when the griddle heat settings are at the Low, Medium, and High settings, just to fully understand what your working with in regards to your specific griddle. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"22px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:22px">Bottom-line, all griddle manufacturers and cooking surfaces will have different BTU ratings. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"22px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:22px">Each will give different heat zones based on the cooking surface material, thickness, heating element placements, and BTU strength. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"22px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:22px">Ok folks, I hope your new griddle gets you as happy as it does for me. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"22px"}}} -->
