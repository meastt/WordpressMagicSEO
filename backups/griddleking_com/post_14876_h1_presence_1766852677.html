<p>Flat top grilling, or griddle cooking, is an art that combines the robust flavors of outdoor cooking with the finesse of a chef. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Today, I want to share my personal list of the 9 best flat top grill accessories that have seriously upped my backyard cooking game. These gadgets are not just tools; they’re the sidekicks that turn a good grilling session into a great one.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Understanding the Flat Top Grill</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Before we dive into the accessories, let’s talk about the flat top grill itself. Unlike the traditional ridged grills, a flat top is a smooth cooking surface that’s incredibly versatile. I like to think of it as the Swiss Army knife of outdoor cookers – from pancakes to Philly cheesesteaks, this bad boy does it all.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Foundation of Great Grilling</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of the first accessories I got myself was a set of high-quality spatulas. I prefer ones with a sturdy stainless-steel blade and a comfortable grip. A long spatula allows me to flip burgers with ease, while a slotted turner lets the oil drain away perfectly. I've got a funny story about the time I used a flimsy spatula that bent under the weight of a hefty porterhouse – lesson learned!</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Melty Cheese? Yes, Please!</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Picture a perfectly toasted bun topped with a burger and a layer of cheese that’s just begging to melt. That’s where basting covers, or cheese melting domes, come in. These guys trap heat and steam to speed up cooking and give you that gooey, melty goodness. Plus, they reduce flare-ups and help infuse smoke flavor.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Grasp, Flip, and Serve with Confidence</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I learned early on not to skimp on tongs. Your tongs are an extension of your hands. Mine are about 16 inches long – perfect for keeping my mitts away from the heat. They’re also great for delicately flipping veggies or fish without puncturing them like a fork would.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Cleanup Can Be a Breeze</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cleaning might be the least glamorous part of grilling, but it’s necessary. That’s where grease traps come in. A good trapping system catches runoff and keeps your griddle surface clean. Remember, a dirty flat top can ruin flavor and cause sticky situations – quite literally.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mother Nature can be unpredictable, but a good cover for your flat top grill ensures you're ready for whatever she throws at you. Look for a weather-resistant and heavy-duty cover. A little personal confession: I was once lazy and left my grill uncovered – a storm hit and, well, let’s just say I learned why covers are so important.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Expand Your Recipe Repertoire</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Grill mats have been a versatile favorite of mine. They open up the possibilities of cooking foods that would otherwise fall through a regular grill's grates. They're fantastic for griddling smaller items like shrimp or delicate fish fillets – and cleanup is a snap. The folks at <a href="http://grydlmat.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-lasso-id="11602">Grydlmat</a> are pretty much the industry standard for a quality griddle mat.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Cook at the Right Heat Every Time</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Whether I'm aiming for a rare steak or perfectly seared chicken, keeping an eye on the temperature is key. A reliable temperature gauge helps me ensure the griddle is at the ideal heat level. Trust me, temperature guesswork leads to either overcooked or undercooked disappointments. This <a href="https://blackstoneproducts.com/products/infrared-thermometer-with-probe" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-lasso-id="11603">temp gauge from Blackstone</a> is pretty nice.</p>

<p>Finally, a good cleaning kit is essential. A sturdy scraper gets rid of burnt bits, and cleaning pads help in scrubbing the surface without damaging it. This kind of maintenance not only prolongs the life of your flat top but also makes sure every meal is as tasty as the last.</p>
