<h2><strong>What is a Masterbuilt Electric Smoker?</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A <a href="https://griddleking.com/best-camping-kitchen-grill-griddle-pellet-smoker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-lasso-id="2854">smoker</a> is a type of cooking device that uses low, slow indirect heat to cook food. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This method of cooking results in tender, juicy meats that are packed with flavor. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://griddleking.com/pellet-smoker-vs-electric-smoker/" data-lasso-id="9587">Electric smokers</a> are a great option for those who want to enjoy the benefits of smoking without having to deal with charcoal or gas. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These smokers are easy to use and maintain, and they provide consistent results. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Electric smokers work through convection, but you also have the option to include natural <a href="https://griddleking.com/can-you-use-fig-wood-bbq-smoke/" data-lasso-id="9642">smoke by heating wood</a> chips that have been soaked in water. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The wood chips smolder, creating smoke that flavors the food as it cooks. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Most electric smokers come with a built-in thermostat, so you can set the temperature and walk away. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When smoking meat, it's important to keep the temperature between 225 and 275 degrees Fahrenheit. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This low-slow cooking process allows the fat and juices to render, resulting in tender, flavorful meat.</p>

<h2><strong>What Is an Extension Cord and What Are Its Uses?</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An <a href="https://bbqbarbecuegrill.com/grilling-accessories/electric-smoker-power-cord/" data-lasso-id="2855">extension cord</a> is a length of electrical wire with a male plug on one end and a female socket on the other. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The male plug can be inserted into a nearby outlet, while the female socket can be connected to an electric smoker. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This allows the smoker to be placed in a more convenient location, away from the outlet. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Extension cords are available in a variety of lengths, from just a few feet to over 100 feet. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The length of the cord you need will depend on the distance between the outlet and the desired smoking location. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When using an extension cord, it is important to choose one that is rated for use with smokers. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This information can be found on the product packaging. Using a cord with the wrong rating can result in damage to your smoker or even start a fire.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You should also avoid using extension cords with multiple appliances. Plugging more than one appliance into an extension cord can cause the cord to overheat. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is a serious safety hazard that can lead to fires. If you need to use multiple appliances, it's best to plug them into separate outlets.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h2><strong>How to Determine if You Need an Extension Cord for Your Smoker</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Whether you're using an electric, charcoal, or <a href="https://griddleking.com/best-camping-kitchen-grill-griddle-pellet-smoker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-lasso-id="2856">pellet smoker</a>, there's always a risk of fire if you don't take the proper precautions. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of the most important safety measures is to make sure your smoker is properly plugged into an outlet. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If the cord isn't long enough to reach the outlet, then you'll need to use an extension cord. However, it's important to choose the right extension cord for your smoker. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If the cord is too small, it could overheat and start a fire. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To be on the safe side, always use a heavy-duty extension cord that is at least 16 AWG (American Wire Gauge) in diameter and no longer than 25 feet in length. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the proper extension cord, you can enjoy your smoker without worry.</p>

<h2><strong>What Type of Extension Cord Should You Use with Your Smoker?</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you're planning on using an electric smoker, you'll need to make sure you have the right extension cord. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A standard household extension cord is not going to cut it —you'll need something that can handle a lot of power. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The best type of extension cord to use with a smoker is a heavy-duty outdoor cord. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These cords are specifically designed to handle heavy loads, and they're also weather-resistant. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That means they won't be damaged by the elements, even if they're exposed to <a href="https://griddleking.com/can-you-use-a-pit-boss-pellet-grill-in-the-rain/" data-lasso-id="9684">rain</a> or snow —though you shouldn’t be using an electric smoker in the rain. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And because they're specifically designed for outdoor use, they won't pose a fire hazard like some indoor extension cords can. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So if you're looking for the best way to power your <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Country-Smokers-CSGDL0590-Highland-4-Burner/dp/B088RK43CP?tag=griddleking01-20&ref_=as_li_ss_tl&linkCode=sl1&linkId=2b41f5f337617dabe31f2ac8255cf4b8" target="_blank" rel="nofollow sponsored noopener" data-lasso-id="2857" data-lasso-name="Country Smokers CSGDL0590 The Highland 4-Burner Portable Griddle, Large, Black" data-lasso-lid="7725">smoker</a>, make sure you get a heavy-duty extension cord which measures at least 16 AWG in diameter —the smaller the number, the larger the gauge. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s also important that it doesn’t exceed 25 feet in length. </p>

<h2><strong>How to Safely Use an Extension Cord with Your Smoker</strong></h2>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you're like most people, you probably don't think too much about extension cords. But if you're using an electric smoker, it's important to choose the right cord and to use it safely.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Otherwise, you could end up with a fire or an electrical shock. Here are a few tips to help you choose and use extension cords safely with your electric smoker.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>First, make sure the cord is rated for indoor or outdoor use, depending on where you'll be using it. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Second, check the amperage rating of the cord to make sure it can handle the current draw of your smoker. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Third, always plug the cord into a <a href="https://www.osha.gov/electrical/hazards/grounding/gfci" data-lasso-id="2858">ground fault circuit interrupter</a> (GFCI) outlet to protect against electrical shocks. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally, don't use an extension cord that is damaged in any way. If the cord is frayed or has exposed wires, it's time to get a new one.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By following these simple tips, you can enjoy your smoker without worry. Just make sure to choose the right extension cord and use it safely.</p>
